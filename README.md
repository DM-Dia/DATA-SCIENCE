Document Analysis Using LLMs

InsightPulse is an AI-powered platform designed to automate the analysis of diverse documents and video transcripts using Large Language Models (LLMs). It supports PDF, YouTube links, structured SQL data, enabling users to extract actionable insights through a conversational interface. The system uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Pinecone for semantic search, LangChain for multi-agent orchestration, and a SQL agent for querying structured data. The backend supports Gemini and Ollama, with a frontend built using Streamlit.
