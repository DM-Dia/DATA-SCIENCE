Actor Manoj Bajpayee also shared a heartfelt message on social media. He wrote, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs impossible to put into words what I‚Äôm feeling.

Mukul Dev's brother and actor Rahul Dev, who lost his wife to cancer many years back, had spoken about how he values life. In an older interview, he had said, "" I have lost a life partner to a disease. I truly believe this from the core of my heart when we say that there is no soul, it's just a shadow. But I haven't seen all this. Tangibly, I haven't seen that there is a soul inside. I haven't had any real experience."" He added, ""But I know that when someone is sick, no matter how many people say they should leave and all those complaints people do, we saw in the lockdown, when this virus came, did truly anyone want to die? Did truly anyone really want to not survive? Did truly anyone not want to live another day for a brighter sun? I mean, I have lost a life partner to a disease. So, you know, I think, I love my body a lot. I feel like it's a gift. A very rare gift, a very rare blessing, pronounced to us by somebody above us.""

Mukul Dev played a cop in Dastak; coincidentally his father was also a policeman. Recalling his first day of shooting at the police station, Vikram Bhatt told Filmfare, ""He had to walk in, addressing a crime scene while nonchalantly eating breakfast.

While that officially marked the beginning of his career as an actor, not many know that Mukul had earlier shot for a film titled Naam Kya Hai, which was bankrolled by Amitabh Bachchan‚Äôs company ABCL. However, the film got shelved.

Vindu Dara Singh shared his reaction on Mukul Dev's death and told SCREEN, ""It is very sad, our heart is broken. We just did a movie, Son Of Sardaar 2 in August last year, we spent 30 days 24x7 together. After that we were waiting for the movie to release and he is gone. I wasn't aware of the hospitalization, but I knew he was not well. We had a photoshoot, and he didn't show up, that's when we got to know that he was not well.""
Vindu Dara Singh told SCREEN, ""He was in depression after his mother passed away, he never let that go, was very close to his parents. He would feel alone, and then he would start on a drink and have gutka, then he wouldn't stop. There was nobody to control him.

Film critic and journalist Mayank Shekhar posted on X, ""Mukul Dev & SRK went to the same Delhi school (St Columba‚Äôs)‚Äîalthough the latter was much senior; had a profound impact on Mukul‚Äôs life (from a distance), as he‚Äôd tell me. Mukul started out as a bona fide Bollywood star w/ Mahesh Bhatt‚Äôs Dastak (1996), opposite Sushmita Sen, whilst she had just won Miss Universe, making her own film debut alongside. Mukul played a cop in the film. That‚Äôs what his dad was, with the Delhi Police. Mukul himself trained as a commercial pilot & could‚Äôve easily carried on that flight path. But he chose movies (& modelling). He also chose to work, without ever thinking so hard about where he was, once (lead/star), to doing variety roles, later (in multiple language, including television). He worshipped work, for work‚Äôs sake. There was so much to learn from Mukul; chiefly, equanimity. I hosted a masterclass with him in Dehradun once, for a film festival, and we continued chatting through the night, at an after-party hosted by a friend of mine at Doon School. Also, visited his Andheri home a couple of times, where you could instantly tell‚Äîa generous host, great conversationalist, and more than everything else, a happy, likeable & fun soul. Go well, Mukul. See you on the other side!""
Mukul Dev once got a call Mr Amitabh Bachchan‚Äôs office for a film. ""When I was in Mumbai I got a call from Mr Amitabh Bachchan‚Äôs office, saying they wanted me to do a film for them. It was my first film, which unfortunately didn't see the light of the day. For the first time, I was sitting next to Mrs Jaya Bachchan and Mr Amitabh Bachchan walked out, and I can never ever forget that moment,"" shared the actor in his interview with Eastern Eye.
Talking about being a pilot, the actor once shared in an interview with Eastern Eye, ""I was a pilot before I became an actor. So I will never forget clearing my flying academy exams and getting a scholarship to become a commercial pilot. I could have not have asked for anything better. I was ranked number four among so many pilots across the country, from one of the best training schools called Indira Gandhi Udaan Academy. I was so thrilled to know that I would be a commercial pilot.""
Actor Sonu Sood took to his X account to post, ""RIP Mukul bhai ? You were a gem. Will always miss you. Stay strong @RahulDevRising bhai.""
In an old interview with Eastern Eye, Mukul Dev once talked about some of his most memorable life moments. Talking about his 'heroic father' he said, ""I will never forget my father getting gallantry awards for his bravery. There was a particular one he received for saving an entire police station at Daryagunj, which was surrounded and supposed to be lit up. He went there and managed the entire mob alone, and got a gallantry award for that. That‚Äôs something I remember well.""
Deepshikha said while she has not spoken to the family, she is told that Mukul Dev suffered a heart attack. ""But this is shocking. I have no clue about him being hospitalized, and that‚Äôs what I am wondering... what kind of friends. I am so upset, that I am hearing from people he was hospitalized and got a heart attack. I am also trying to find out, but everyone in the family too wouldn't be in a right state of mind. It is a big loss.""
Actor Deepshikha Nagpal told SCREEN, ""We were always in touch on the phone and over WhatsApp groups. But he never mentioned about his health, I kept seeing his posts where he was working and doing a good job. Couldn't meet him since 6-7 months since I was shooting and he was travelling. None of us had a clue that he was unwell, he was always a very happy and positive person. In the morning I called up on his number thinking he would pick up and say it's fake news.""
Rahul Dev took to his Instagram story to post, ""We are deeply saddened to inform you that our brother Mukul Dev passed away peacefully last night in New Delhi. He is survived by his daughter, Sia Dev, and will be dearly missed by his siblings Rashmi Kaushal, Rahul Dev, and his nephew Sidhant Dev.""
While acting was his profession, actor Mukul Dev was also a trained pilot from the Indira Gandhi Rashtriya Uran Akademi. He had shared a post of an aircraft with the caption, ""Echo November India. She gave me wings and taught me a few tricks in the skies. #learningtofly.""
Mukul Dev was brother of actor Rahul Dev and their father, Hari Dev, was an assistant commissioner of police, and was the one who introduced him to Afghan culture. Reportedly, a biopic on his father was in the making.
Actor Mukul Dev's last Instagram post was made on February 26 where he was seen flying an aircraft cross-country. The caption read, ""And if your head explodes with dark forebodings too.... I'll see you on the dark side of the moon.""
Actor Vindu Dara Singh confirmed the news of actor Mukul Dev's death and paid tribute on social media. ""Rest in peace my brother #MukulDev ! The time spent with you will always be cherished and #SonOfSardaar2 will be your swansong where you will spread joy and happiness to the viewers and make them fall down laughing !,"" wrote the actor.
Industry tracker Vamsi Kaka shared via X, ""Popular actor #MukulDev passed away last night at 54 due to health related issues. He is known in Tollywood for his roles in Krishna, Adhurs and Ek Niranjan. Om Shanti."""
"Shubman Gill, the Test captain: Calm, competitive but still a work-in-progress",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/shubman-gill-test-captain-competitive-calm-work-in-progress-10025723/,"It‚Äôs not often that a player who was nearly dropped just a year back becomes the Test captain. It‚Äôs definitely not often that a player who was dropped from the playing XI midway during the last Test series that India played, just months back, becomes the captain. But here we are, due to the big-ticket retirements of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli along with the selectors‚Äô lack of confidence in the other captaincy candidates ‚Äì Jasprit Bumrah, KL Rahul and Rishabh Pant ‚Äì that Shubman Gill, 24, has been anointed as India‚Äôs Test captain.
In 2024 during the England home series, Gill, struggling with his form, almost lost his place in the Test side. But he bounced back strongly. Later he was on drinks duty for the Melbourne Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy this year in Australia. He got his place back only after captain Rohit decided to drop himself on a grassy-green Sydney track for the final Test of the series.
It‚Äôs what he did in that Test that needs a rewind, but first the lead-up to his anointment.
FOLLOW:India Test Squad Announcement For England Tour Highlights
TheIPLhas worked out favourably to his cause, and to the detriment of the other captaincy contenders.LSGskipper Pant and his team were listless. AtDelhi Capitals, Rahul wasn‚Äôt leading the side even when skipperAxar Patelgot injured. Not to forget that Rahul was dropped after just one Test in India‚Äôs last home series last year, a historic whitewash defeat to New Zealand.
All-rounderRavindra Jadeja, now the senior-most in the team, was never going to be seriously considered as a captain at this stage of his international career. Certainly not after MS Dhoni reinstalled himself to replace Jadeja as theCSKcaptain midway during one IPL season.
Gill‚Äôs traits during IPL that has attracted the legends have been interesting. For Sunil Gavaskar, it was the ‚Äúcompetitiveness‚Äù. Gill would be the first to rush to umpires when he was not happy with a decision. For Ravi Shastri, it was the way Gill remained ‚Äúcalm, composed‚Äù. Those adjectives are positive, though it‚Äôs perhaps better to lean in on the men who have been with Gill, in the same camp to understand how he functions. The former India players in theGujarat Titansdressing room ‚Äì coach Ashish Nehra, mentorParthiv Pateland pacerIshant Sharma‚Äì have all spoken about their captain to the IPL broadcaster.
Ishant‚Äôs views as a player from a few weeks back are probably the most telling; he cued up scenes from timeouts during IPL to make his interesting point.
‚ÄúTimeouts are crucial. Sometimes Gill feels we should be bowling a particular type of delivery or this or that should happen. Then Ashish Nehra comes in and says, ‚Äòno, the first thing that should happen is what the bowler wants‚Äô. And a good captain is a person who is a bowler‚Äôs captain. He should give the freedom to the bowler and back the bowler‚Äôs decisions. If that doesn‚Äôt work, then we go to plan B. That‚Äôs what Gill does. He is now learning a lot as a captain and I am sure in the upcoming years we will see ‚Äòhim happening way more‚Äô than what he is doing right now,‚Äù Ishant said.
Learning to toggle that primary instinct with that of the team is good, and though there might not be ‚Äúupcoming years‚Äù but mere days to see ‚Äúhim happening way more‚Äù for the sake of India. Though Ishant‚Äôs stressing for patience and more time is certainly something that all the stakeholders should keep in mind as Gill‚Äôs time as captain begins.
There was a line from Parthiv Patel too that shines a light on another facet of his functioning style. ‚ÄúHe is very good with youngsters ‚Ä¶ makes his presence felt in the dressing room. He doesn‚Äôt talk much but his words carry a lot of weight,‚Äù Patel had said.
Not talking much or being shy is a trait also noted by the motor-mouth coach Nehra, who has had the greatest hand in moulding two of the current big stars in Indian cricket ‚Äì Gill andHardik Pandya.
‚ÄúSomeone like Gill if he can captain a team for 3-4 years, keeping his feet in the ground, and learning from past (mistakes) and progress ‚Äì which is his nature, and he also remains a bit shy, then the sky is the limit,‚Äù Nehra had said a month back. ‚ÄúWe have had conversations for a year. A person learns from his experience also. This year things will only go better and better. I am not talking about results but Gill as a person, as a captain, taking the (IPL) team forward.‚Äù
It‚Äôs clear that those who have worked with him do seem to believe that he is a work in progress, not a finished product or even potentially-ready as Graeme Smith was when he was asked to lead South Africa as a 22-year-old. But in extraordinary circumstances, certain bold decisions need to be taken- and with the exit of Rohit and Kohli, India had to swing this way.
There will be a temptation to see Gill‚Äôs rise as in line withVirat Kohli‚Äôs ‚Äì the ‚Äòprince‚Äô in waiting taking over, but that would be missing a certain key nuance. Not only was Kohli not fighting for his own spot till the last instant as Gill has been now, his personality and demeanour had set him very early as a leader. Thus there was no major handwringing when MS Dhoni quit captaincy midway during a Test series as he and others thought Kohli was ready.
The flipbook of recent Indian Test captains show they were all ready:Rohit Sharma, Kohli, Dhoni, Anil Kumble,Rahul Dravid,Sourav Ganguly. Tendulkar was thought to be born to lead India; so while the results didn‚Äôt go that way, there was no doubt when he took over at first. One has to hark all the way back to Mohammad Azharuddin when the board president Rajsingh Dungarpur suddenly asked him, ‚ÄúMian, captain banoge?‚Äùto the surprise of the player himself to find a case of a captain with inherent doubts.
Gill is certainly more ready than Azharuddin was, but not as ready as the others that followed. Gary Kirsten, Gujarat Titans coach when Gill became captain last season, talked about how ‚Äúhe‚Äôs really keen to do the job‚Äù and how coaches ‚Äúhave to assist him‚Äù. Under Nehra‚Äôs care, Gill must have learnt a lot of nitty-gritties on the cricketing intelligence needed and he recently spoke about his biggest learning.
‚ÄúThere were a few games last year where I was thinking a lot and couldn‚Äôt do well. You play at your best when you don‚Äôt confuse captaincy with batting. Then Ashu pa (Nehra) told me just think as a batsman, don‚Äôt think as a captain, there is no great relation. That helped me a lot,‚Äù Gill said.
It‚Äôs vital learning, but he will also do well to temper the two, or rather work his way out as a batsman while playing in Tests. There were a couple of moments from the series-decider at Sydney in January this year that‚Äôs worth a rewind.
With the series hanging in line, after coming back into the team at expense of Rohit, on the last ball before lunch on opening day, he had an impetuous dash down the track to Nathan Lyon ‚Äì and was stumped by miles.Steve Smithat first slip, and a couple of close-in fielders were sledging him about the time wastage, and his response was that charge to nowhere off the final ball. Then in the second innings, with the game in balance, he yet again rushed down the track, this time to the medium pacer Beau Webster, inside-edging to the wicketkeeper.
What would Gill the captain do in those moments now? His learning is he can‚Äôt let the captain dictate the batsmen, but he also has to find a way to curb the recklessness of a young batsman, and think more maturely as a captain. Fascinating times present fascinating challenges ‚Äì and how he deals these little big moments, helped along by the coachGautam Gambhir, will determine his longevity as India‚Äôs new leader.

This officially begins the new era for the Indian red-ball set-up after the shock retirements of Rohit and Virat Kohli.
Earlier, both stalwarts ‚Äî Rohit and Kohli ‚Äî pulled the plug from their glittering Test careers, announcing their retirement from this format withina span ofone week.

Rishabh Panthas been named Gill‚Äôs deputy starting from India‚Äôs tour of England.
Earlier, it was reported byThe Indian ExpressthatGill was the front-runner to captain the men‚Äôs Test teamafter incumbent Rohit announced his retirement. The senior selection committee, headed by former India all-rounder Ajit Agarkar, is of the opinion that 25-year-old Gill is the ideal candidate to take over as Test captain. However, the selectors were to discuss the same with the BCCI before making a formal announcement. This paper had earlier reported how India‚Äôs fast bowling figurehead and vice-captainJasprit Bumrahis unlikely to be given a leadership role on the Test tour to England starting June-end.
The star fast bowler had captained India to its only Test match win during the Australia tour at the turn of the year, apart from leading in two other Tests. But since Bumrah is unlikely to feature in allthe fiveTests in England, as part of his workload management, the selectors had to look at another option.
India‚Äôs Test series against England is scheduled to kick off from June 20 with the fifth and final Test starting July 31.

How Sai Sudharsan was motivated after watching Kohli's intense training sessions,https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/sai-sudharsan-india-selection-england-tour-virat-kohli-alec-stewart-10025631/,"This was a dream that was ignited during the lockdown by a mom, who could no longer watch her son being distracted. Usha Bharadwaj, a former state-level volleyball player and now a strength and conditioning coach, would show her son B Sai Sudharsan videos of Virat Kohli‚Äôs intensity while training. Sai Sudharsan found a spark, transforming himself into a quality batsman that Indian cricket couldn‚Äôt ignore. And five years later, with his idol who inspired retiring, and opening up a spot in the Indian team, Sai Sudharsan got his big break.
As the selectors gave a maiden Test call-up to Sai Sudharsan, it hardly came as a surprise. He may not have compelling numbers in the domestic circuit, but through the course of each season including theIPL, has shown why he has the potential to become the next big all-format batsman for India. Three ODI caps have already been earned and a Test cap now looks a definite possibility in England, where he is widely tipped to bat at No.3.
Behind his rise to the Indian team is the story of his family‚Äôs incredible support and sacrifice.
‚ÄúMy mother takes care of my strength and conditioning and my dad (R Bharadwaj, a former national-level athlete) handles my running aspect. And I have my brother (B Sai Ram) who offers all the support. They know me completely. They understand my emotions. Because they are knowledgeable, they can make a difference in my life.‚Äù Sai Sudharsan tellsThe Indian Express.
FOLLOW:India Test Squad Announcement For England Tour Highlights
Last December, Sai Sudharsan needed their support. Troubled by sports hernia, he had opted for a surgery in London where he was all by himself. His brother, residing in Australia, knew his younger sibling needed support and would make phone calls to ensure their parents could get a visa to be beside Sai Sudharsan. ‚ÄúIt all happened at the last minute and thanks to my brother, my parents were there a day after the surgery. I was in no position to move for the first three days, so having them around was a huge help. It is such moments that remind me how fortunate I‚Äôm to have such parents. They always think about me and my brother. They also have a lot of things going on in their lives, but they always put our interests at the forefront. As I‚Äôm growing older, I‚Äôm getting to understand the value of their sacrifices. But they won‚Äôt show it, even now when she calls, all that she wants to know is if I had my meal or not,‚Äù Sai Sudharsan says.
All that combined hard work and sacrifices has taken Sai Sudharsan to the place where many expected him to be. From being this young left-hander, who nonchalantly on-drive R Ashwin through a vacant mid-wicket region that made those in TN cricket to take notice, in the last three IPLs, he has now become a batsman who Indian cricket is pinning plenty of hope on, especially in Test cricket.
Sai Sudharsan doesn‚Äôt seem perturbed about a possible Test debut in England. ‚ÄúThe experience of playing County cricket is a massive thing,‚Äù he says about his stints with Surrey over the last two seasons. ‚ÄúThose two years in those six-seven games, I have learnt a lot about batting. Playing in England, you cannot relax as a batsman. It was an eye-opener for me where I understood I can‚Äôt take the technical aspects lightly. If certain technical things are difficult for you, then you could stand exposed. In the first few matches I was exposed and I struggled a lot with my batting. But it gave me the experience very early. I got an idea about how to play in England. I spoke to a lot of their cricketers to get an idea so that when I go next, I don‚Äôt feel shy. Those matches helped improve my awareness,‚Äù Sai Sudharsan adds.
Alec Stewart‚Äôs help
Former England captain and director of Surrey Alec Stewart would be of great help for Sai Sudharsan. Having received the call-up even before he made his India debut, Stewart had helped the left-hander settle in the city and also passed on a few tips required to succeed as a batsman. ‚ÄúOff the wicket, there is a lot of lateral movement. So, you have to hold the position better. You have to play the ball as late as possible. You have to play it with soft hands and as close to the body as possible,‚Äù he says.
These sound lessons are something Sai Sudharsan has tried to incorporate in his batting not just in English conditions but also at home. In an IPL where he is leading the run-charts, it is his technical correctness that has stood out. And the 23-year-old explains the reason as well. ‚ÄúAs a batsman, when you are juggling between formats, I believe only the mindset should change, not your game. To be honest, I‚Äôve been trying to play the same way even in IPL, because you can‚Äôt suddenly go to a new place, get rid of a particular game and pick up a new one. I don‚Äôt make a big change from my set-up or from my movement. But, mindset-wise, there is a big shift. Tactical-wise, there is a big shift. When I go to England, I have to leave a lot more balls than I usually do,‚Äù he says.
After a pause he puts a question across. ‚ÄúI hope I‚Äôm not talking like an analyst? I‚Äôve not succeeded in England. I‚Äôm only getting to understand how to play.‚Äù
Unlike Abhimany Easwaran with whom he is likely to compete for a slot in the Test XI, Sai Sudharsan may not have a bucketful of runs in Ranji Trophy or domestic circuit. But he for sure is a player who has gone through the grind and also picked up lessons from IPL, County cricket and India A levels.
‚ÄúNothing prepares you for the top level like our Ranji Trophy. For example, last season we played our first game at Coimbatore and the next was atDelhi. Completely contrasting venues and conditions with just three days to acclimatise and adjust. You keep doing it through the season and there are a lot of variables at play, which you have to learn. I was really upset that I missed a lot of it because of the surgery. These exposures help us a lot to learn and adapt quickly. England will no doubt be tough, but it all comes down to preparation. A tough question paper will sound easy if you are thorough with the lessons,‚Äù he says.
During the 1996 tour of England, Indian cricket got a graceful left-handed batsman inSourav Gangulywho went on to play 113 Tests. 30 years later, another elegant left-hander will head to England with plenty of hope and optimism at a critical juncture for the Indian Test team.

‚ÄúMentally, we will have to be switched on for the IPL first. Once that story is over, then we can probably think about the India ‚ÄòA‚Äô story. But definitely happy for that opportunity, and I think I would have a great time there,‚Äù said Sudharsan after the game against Lucknow Super Giants.

Agarkar on Arshdeep Singh's inclusion:""He's a quality bowler and has had a taste of counTy as well. he plays domestic when he can. A tall guy, can bowl with the new ball, has body of work in red-ball cricket and in recent form in the last couple of years. Bumrah unlikely to play all five Tests, we needed a bit of variety.""
Agarkar on Nair's experience:""Sometimes you just have to make good decisions. Sarfaraz, I know he got a 100 in the first Test and then didn't get runs. Sometimes it's decisions the team management takes. At the moment, Karun has scored heaps of runs in domestic, has played a bit of Test cricket, played a bit of county cricket. With Virat not there, clearly we're lacking a bit of experience. We felt his experience could help. ""
Agarkar:More important to us a player. Once you're managing people, there's a lot that takes out of you. We've had a chat with him, he's okay with it. He knows where his body's at. KL not really, he's captained a while back, he's a quality player and hope he has a big series. With Booms, it was more about his workload management.""
'When guys like Rohit and Virat retire, always big holes to fill. Ashwin also retired. Those three have been stalwarts. Always difficult. One way of looking at it is, opportunity for someone else. Had conversations with both of them. Virat reached out early April, seen him give 200% every ball he plays even when he's not batting or on the field. Felt he'd given everything he had, if he can't keep up to the standards it was time for him. It's come from him. Have to respect that. They've earned that respect.'
Agarkar on Shami:""He's had a little bit of a setback over the past week, got some MRIs done. Wasn't going to be able to play five Tests. Don't think his workload is where he needs to be. Medical guys told he'll be ruled out. We were hoping he'll play some part, but if he's not fit, we'd rather pick guys fit and available rather than waiting.""
It‚Äôs not often that a player who was nearly dropped just a year back becomes the Test captain. It‚Äôs definitely not often that a player who was dropped from the playing XI midway during the last Test series that India played, just months back, becomes the captain. But here we are, due to the big-ticket retirements of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli along with the selectors‚Äô lack of confidence in the other captaincy candidates ‚Äì Jasprit Bumrah, KL Rahul and Rishabh Pant ‚Äì that Shubman Gill, 24, has been anointed as India‚Äôs Test captain.Sriram Veera on India's new Test captain
This was a dream that was ignited during the lockdown by a mom, who could no longer watch her son being distracted. Usha Bharadwaj, a former state-level volleyball player and now a strength and conditioning coach, would show her son B Sai Sudharsan videos of Virat Kohli‚Äôs intensity while training. Sai Sudharsan found a spark, transforming himself into a quality batsman that Indian cricket couldn‚Äôt ignore. And five years later, with his idol who inspired retiring, and opening up a spot in the Indian team, Sai Sudharsan got his big break.Venkata Krishna writes on Sai Sudharsan's run to the Test team

Is Shubman Gill the youngest Indian Test men's skipper?Well, he won't be, not quite. Sachin Tendulkar was only 23 years old when he led India for the first time in a Test in 1996 against Australia in Delhi. There are a few more young skippers that India have had over the years...
Youngest Indian Test captains
Aged 25y 258d today, Gill could become the fourth-youngest player to lead India in a Test when the England series begins on June 20.
Shubman Gill in Tests -MT: 32; Runs: 1893; AVE: 35.05; 100s: 5; 50s: 7
Gill in England:MT: 3; Runs: 88; AVE: 14.66; 50s: 0
In the wake of Rohit and Kohli's exit, a hoard of changes are expected in the line-up. It will begin with Shubman Gill likely moving to the prime No. 4 slot and a new contender emerging on either side at 3 and 5. Despite his solid performances at number five, KL Rahul is primed to take over the opening role alongside Yashasvi Jaiswal after having put in sturdy bits in the 24-25 BGT and the previous tour to England in 2021.
Four batters in Sai Sudharsan, Karun Nair, Sarfaraz Khan and Shreyas Iyer will be up for discussions to slot in two of the spots at No. 3 and No. 5. While Iyer runs an outside chance, the impressive Sudharsan is all but certain to earn his maiden Test call-up.
Mohammed Shami's potential absence from the squad could create an opening for either left-arm paceman Arshdeep Singh or Haryana's right-arm seamer Anshul Kamboj. Kamboj boasts an impressive first-class record with 74 wickets in 22 matches.
Arshdeep Singh emerges as a strong contender, particularly given his valuable county cricket experience with Kent last season. Meanwhile, Anshul Kamboj has already earned a call-up to the India A squad that is set to tour England, indicating the selection committee's confidence in his abilities.
It indeed seems like Mohammed Shami's international career future is under a cloud. The BCCI‚Äôs medical team has informed the Indian board that the 34-year-old pacer won‚Äôt be able to bowl longer spells. Chances of him playing all the five Test matches are bleak too, going ahead and the selectors will be apprehensive of carrying him alongside Jasprit Bumrah for the gruelling series.
Shami hasn't featured in a Test for India since the WTC final against Australia in 2023.READ MORE
The Indian Express had previously reported that Shubman Gill is the front-runner take over the Test captaincy from Rohit Sharma.
The Indian Express understands that the senior selection committee headed by former India all rounder Ajit Agarkar is of the opinion that 25-year-old Gill is the ideal candidate to take over as Test captain.READ MORE

WITH just few days left before the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) picks its squad for the five-match Test series against England, it is learnt that the senior selection committee is likely to leave out ace pacerMohammed Shamifrom the tour.
BCCI‚Äôs medical team has informed the Indian board that the 34-year-old pacer won‚Äôt be able to bowl longer spells. Chances of him playing all the five Test matches are bleak too, going ahead. There were deliberations over taking Shami along with the Indian team and playing him in few games. However, withJasprit Bumrahalready informing the board that his body can‚Äôt take the toll of more than three Tests matches, the selection committee were known to be in a dilemma on whether to fly out with a similarly iffy bowler, who might only play few games. It hampers the planning of the Indian side too...READ MORE
The first step to India's full-blown Test transition will begin this afternoon in Mumbai when chief selector Ajit Agarkar announces the Test squad for the England tour.

Health worker in Gujarat arrested for 'spying' for Pakistan intelligence,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/ahmedabad/gujarat-pakistan-spying-inteliigence-kutch-espionage-10025865/,"The Gujarat Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) on Saturday arrested a 28-year-old health worker from the border district of Kutch, alleging his involvement in espionage activities on behalf of a Pakistani intelligence officer. The case marks the third such arrest from Gujarat for alleged spying in the past eight months.
The accused, Sahdevsinh Deepubha Gohil, a contractual multipurpose health worker (MPH) posted at the Mata-na-Madh Primary Health Centre, was arrested for allegedly transmitting sensitive photographs and videos concerning the Border Security Force (BSF) and Indian Navy to an operative he knew only as ‚ÄúAditi Bharadwaj‚Äù.
According to ATS officials, Gohil came into contact with Bharadwaj via WhatsApp in mid-2023. In a press briefing Saturday, ATS officials said Bharadwaj identified herself as an agent of the Pakistani intelligence services and instructed Gohil to supply imagery of security installations ‚Äî some still under construction, others newly completed ‚Äî belonging to the BSF and Navy in the Kutch region.
By early 2025, Gohil had reportedly acquired a new SIM card using his Aadhaar identification and activated WhatsApp on the device, which he then passed along to Bharadwaj. ATS officials said he continued to send her classified material via that channel. He also allegedly received Rs 40,000 in cash through an intermediary in exchange for the information.
The ATS detained Gohil on May 1 following an investigation involving both technical surveillance and human intelligence inputs, corroborated by central intelligence agencies. He has since been formally arrested. Both Gohil and Aditi Bharadwaj were charged under Sections 61 (criminal conspiracy) and 148 (waging or abetting war against the government) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita.
Authorities were unable to immediately determine the extent of the breach, as significant data had been deleted from Gohil‚Äôs phone, which has now been sent to the Forensic Science Laboratory for recovery and analysis.
An ATS official noted a troubling trend in recent months, in which Pakistani operatives, often posing as women on social media, have allegedly recruited Indian nationals by exploiting personal vulnerabilities or offering financial incentives. ‚ÄúThese people (Pakistanis) have a database and they try to reach out to a wide range of people,‚Äù the officer said. ‚ÄúSome vulnerable people fall into the trap. In several cases like in Porbandar as well, these people were well aware of whom they were sending this sensitive information to.‚Äù
The Kutch arrest follows two other espionage-related cases in Gujarat over the past eight months. On November 29, 2024, ATS officers apprehended Dipesh Batuk Gohel, a resident of Arambhada in Okha taluka of Devbhoomi Dwarka district. Gohel, who worked for three years on Indian Coast Guard (ICG) vessels at the Okha jetty, allegedly sent classified details about those ships to aFacebookcontact named ‚ÄúSahima,‚Äù who claimed to be a Pakistani naval officer. He reportedly received Rs 42,000 for the information.
Earlier, on October 26, 2024, ATS officials arrested Pankaj Kotiya in Porbandar for similar offenses. Kotiya was accused of relaying sensitive information on Indian Coast Guard ship movements to a Pakistan-based woman known as ‚ÄúRiya,‚Äù and had allegedly been paid Rs26,000 through multiple bank accounts."

New Covid-19 subvariant detected in India: Here‚Äôs what you should know,https://indianexpress.com/article/health-wellness/new-covid-19-subvariant-india-what-you-should-know-10026017/,"As various states report a surge in cases of Covid-19, at least one sample of a new subvariant, NB.1.8.1, has been detected in India. This was collected and sequenced in April. The sample has been submitted to India‚Äôs Covid-19 genome sequencing consortium INSACOG from Tamil Nadu.
Most of the Sar-CoV-2 samples sequenced in India over the last couple of weeks were BA.2 and JN.1 variants. Recent media reports have highlighted an increase inCovid-19cases in Singapore and Hong Kong in the last few weeks. As per the preliminary information available, the cases are mostly mild, not associated with unusual severity or mortality.
The World Health Organisation‚Äôs Technical Advisory Group on Virus Evolution has designated the Sars-CoV-2 variant NB.1.8.1 as ‚ÄòVariant Under Monitoring‚Äô ‚Äî a variant with significant changes in virus characteristics but whose epidemiological impact remains unclear.
The variant is derived from a recombinant ancestor XDV.1.5.1, with the earliest samples reported from January 22, 2025. This variant carries six mutations in the spike protein as compared to the currently circulating LP 8.1 and eight mutations as compared to JN.1. Some of these mutations are known to be linked to increased affinity to the human receptors which could increase its transmission, and a reduction in neutralisation, which could result in the virus evading existing immunity more effectively.
As of May 18, there were 518 NB.1.8.1 sequences submitted to the global Covid-19 genome sequence database from 22 countries, representing 10.7 per cent of the globally available sequences.
‚ÄúThis is also a sub-lineage of the Omicron variant and does not appear to be lethal. So far, there is no sign that NB.1.8.1 causes more severe illness than previous strains. But it binds to human cells faster. Early research from China suggests the variant binds more effectively to human cells, which could make it more contagious than its predecessors. Hence it is more easily transmissible,‚Äù says Dr Jatin Ahuja, infectious disease specialist at Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals,Delhi.
Although we do not have a specificvaccinefor this sub-variant, he says, the Omicron wave not too long ago can give us some protection. ‚ÄúPast infection can still trigger memory T cells which can sense the similarity of the virus and can limit disease severity,‚Äù says Dr Ahuja.
Symptoms too are similar like sore throat, cough and fever, all akin to symptoms of flu-like illnesses. Just rest, hydrate yourself, self-isolate and take antivirals. Those with co-morbidities need to mask up and be more hygiene-conscious.
How prepared is India?
The Director General of Health Services (DGHS) has found the current Covid-19 situation in India to be under control. Almost all of the cases so far have been mild, with no hospitalization required. A robust system for surveillance of respiratory viral illnesses, including Covid-19, also exists in the country through the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) and ICMR. The Health Ministry remains vigilant and proactive in monitoring the situation closely.

"Why Trump‚Äôs war on Harvard, other US universities could dent American academic leadership, impact economy",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/us-president-donald-trump-harvard-economy-impact-10025579/,"A legal reprieve notwithstanding, US President Donald Trump‚Äôs escalating attacks on educational institutions such as Harvard University and the targeting of foreign student could be ‚Äúa prescription for failure‚Äù.
Therevocation of Harvard‚Äôs certificationto host international students on Thursday left thousands of students in the lurch. And while students and the Ivy League university, both, face concerns ranging from transferring to another institution to financial pain due to blocked government grants, the US economy will face a blowback too, especially if the Trump administration‚Äôs crackdown spreads to other elite academic institutions.
The number of international students at Harvard steadily increased to 6,793 in the 2024-25 academic year from 3,941 in 2006-07, accounting for over 27 per cent of total enrollments currently, as per data from the university. Of course, the numbers are even larger if one looks beyond Harvard.
In 2023-24, the number of international students in the US in higher education rose to 11.3 lakh, making up 5.9 per cent of total US enrollment of 1.89 crore, according to the Open Doors 2004 report, published in November 2024 by the US Department of State‚Äôs Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs and the Institute of International Education. Harvard, as it turns out, did not even rank in the top-25 institutions in terms of international students, with New York University topping the list with 27,247 overseas students. India, with 3.32 lakh international students in the US, was the top-sending country for the first time since 2009.
On Friday, Harvard sued the Trump administration for blocking the enrollment of international students ‚Äì who it said ‚Äúcontribute significantly to the University and its mission‚Äù ‚Äì and won a temporary restraining order against the government‚Äôs decision to revoke its certification. As the University petitioned in its lawsuit, ‚Äúwith the stroke of a pen, the government has sought to erase a quarter of Harvard‚Äôs student body.‚Äù

The million-plus overseas students in American higher education institutions are also adding meaningfully to the economy. In the 2023-24 academic year, they contributed $43.8 billion to the US economy and supported 3.78 lakh jobs, according to NAFSA: Association of International Educators, formerly known as National Association of Foreign Student Advisers.
‚ÄúThe economic activity total is the highest amount ever calculated by NAFSA, eclipsing the high-water mark of $41 billion in 2018-2019 academic year,‚Äù the association said in November 2024, adding that for every three international students, one American job is either created or supported.
As it turns out, international students had begun to grow cold towards the US even before the Trump administration‚Äôs recent criticism of Harvard and policies that have cut back research and science funding. According to an analysis of Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) data by Chris R. Glass, a Professor of the Practice at Boston College‚Äôs Department of Educational Leadership and Higher Education, international student enrollments were down 11% year-on-year in March 2025.
According to Glass, the fall in international student enrollments could represent ‚Äúa more fundamental restructuring‚Äù, with the 11% decline potentially causing a $4 billion hole in the pockets of US institutions. Glass‚Äô analysis showed the 11% downturn was led by a 28% fall in Indian students.The Indian Expresshad reported in December 2024 that the number of student visas issued to Indians in January-September 2024 were down 38% year-on-year.
Others, too, have begun to voice concerns about the prospect of the US attracting fewer overseas students. Speaking at a tech summit in San Francisco earlier this week, renowned artificial intelligence researcher and Stanford University‚Äôs Sequoia Professor in the Computer Science Department, Fei-Fei Li, warned it was important the US remains a ‚Äúmagnet‚Äù for overseas talent and that the American higher education system continues to be nourished as it was critical to economic growth and innovation.
‚ÄúClosing yourself off from any group, and especially the 97% of the world‚Äôs population that lives outside the United States is a prescription for failure. Damaged universities mean less prosperity and fewer new ideas, ranging from the golf tee to Sesame Street to transplantation to stem cell cures for diabetes to so many more things that came from Harvard research. No small part of that contribution came from foreign scholars. All of that is at risk with these actions,‚Äù former Harvard University President Larry Summers, who has been a regular critic of his old university but has enthusiastically defended the educational institution after Trump‚Äôs recurrent attacks, said in a conversation withPoliticoon Thursday."

"Mukul Dev, the versatile actor who turned to TV after being abandoned by Bollywood",https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/mukul-dev-the-versatile-actor-who-turned-to-tv-after-being-abandoned-by-bollywood-my-career-was-in-a-lurch-10025691/,"Mukul Dev, the versatile actor known for his memorable roles in films like Yamla Pagla Deewana, Son of Sardaar, R‚Ä¶ Rajkumar, and Jai Ho!,passed away at the age of 54. His journey through Indian cinema is a compelling story of ambition, resilience, and a heartfelt return to his cultural roots. Before stepping into the limelight, Mukul trained as a commercial pilot at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Aeronautics, where he ranked fourth in his batch. But his true passion lay elsewhere. An early exposure to entertainment came when, as a Class 8 student, he won his first pay cheque impersonating Michael Jackson during a dance show organized by Doordarshan.
Mukul made his acting debut on television with the serial Mumkin in 1996, portraying Vijay Pandey. He also featured in Doordarshan‚Äôs comedy Bollywood countdown show Ek Se Badh Kar Ek. His talent caught the eye ofAmitabh Bachchan‚Äôs company ABCL, landing him a role in the shelved movie Naam Kya Hai. That same year, he debuted on the big screen with Dastak, playing ACP Rohit Malhotra alongside newly-crowned Miss Universe Sushmita Sen. This film marked the beginning of a promising career. He later appeared in Qila, notable asDilip Kumar‚Äôs final film.
Reflecting on his career, Mukul said to Hindustan Times, ‚ÄúHaving also started my career in the 90s, an era of formula films, it was filmmakers like Ram Gopal Varma who paved the way for the kind of films we now consider a norm rather than an exception.‚Äù However, despite his efforts, Mukul struggled to secure leading roles in mainstream Bollywood. A significant setback came during the making of Kya Kehna in 2000, when he was replaced bySaif Ali Khan. ProducerRamesh Taurani reportedly fired him for arriving late on set.
The early 2000s saw Mukul transition to television, with roles in popular serials like Kahani Ghar Ghar Ki and Pyar Zindagi Hai. He credited television for revitalizing his career, telling Hindustan Times, ‚ÄúTV revived my career when it was in a lurch.‚Äù Expanding his horizons, Mukul began acting in Punjabi, Telugu, and Bengali films, achieving considerable success in Punjabi cinema. Speaking about the challenges of migrating to the Punjabi film industry, he said, ‚ÄúI am from this (Punjabi) soil. My father‚Äôs village is nearJalandharand I spent four to five years in Patiala training as a pilot, so the language has never been an issue for me.‚Äù His connection to Punjab brought authenticity to his roles, and he remained active in Punjabi films until recently.
A lesser-known aspect of Mukul‚Äôs career was his foray into writing. He co-wrote Hansal Mehta‚Äôs film Omerta. Speaking about this creative transition, he told Eastern Eye, ‚ÄúI am an actor, who now also writes, and that passion stems from my love for reading. When I started writing Omerta, it wasn‚Äôt with the intention of making it into a film. But then filmmaker Hansal Mehta picked it up and turned it into a movie. Writing is one of many interests I have and I am sure it will give me more moments like Omerta, but acting will always be my priority.‚Äù

When frequently asked about his elder brother Rahul Dev, who carved out his own niche in the industry as a leading villain in mainstream films, Mukul said, ‚ÄúRahul‚Äôs my elder brother and I feel good to have someone in the industry who has helped me out.‚Äù The news of his passing has sent shockwaves through the entertainment industry, with several colleagues and co-stars expressing their grief on social media.
Mukul‚Äôs elder brother Rahul Dev also shared a message about his last rites. Sharing a photo of Mukul, he wrote, ‚ÄúWe are deeply saddened to inform you that our brother Mukul Dev passed away peacefully last night in NewDelhi. He is survived by his daughter, Sia Dev, and will be dearly missed by his siblings Rashmi Kaushal, Rahul Dev, and his nephew Sidhant Dev. The cremation will take place today at 5 PM.‚Äù
Actor Sonu Sood, who shared screen space with Mukul in films like R‚Ä¶ Rajkumar, took to X (formerly Twitter) to pay tribute. ‚ÄúRIP Mukul bhai üíî You were a gem. Will always miss you. Stay strong @RahulDevRising Bhai,‚Äù he wrote.

The 10-second project: Inside Indian athletics' most ambitious programme,https://indianexpress.com/article/long-reads/10-second-india-amlan-manikanta-animesh-gurindervir-athletics-10025033/,No content found.
Pune Highway explores the many facets of friendship,https://indianexpress.com/article/express-sunday-eye/pune-highway-explores-the-many-facets-of-friendship-10024987/,"Running parallel to the story on the fragility of friendship in the suspense drama Pune Highway is the steadfast camaraderie and collaborative ties of its creators. Bugs Bhargava Krishna and Rahul daCunha ‚Äî the film‚Äôs co-writers and co-directors ‚Äî have worked together for nearly four decades on advertisements and theatre projects. Now they have joined hands to adapt Rahul‚Äôs 2004 play Pune Highway. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a real test of friendship when you work together and still remain friends. We passed,‚Äù says Bhargava.
Rahul and Bhargava belong to a diminishing tribe ofMumbai-based advertising professionals who devote their evenings to making plays. While Bhargava crossed over to films ‚Äî he acted in movies such as Taare Zameen Par (2007), Kaminey (2009),DelhiBelly (2011), A Suitable Boy (2020) as well as directed Barot House (2019) and Nail Polish (2021), theatre kept Rahul occupied. Bhargava, who was part of the original cast of the playPuneHighway, always believed ‚Äúthere was something cinematic‚Äù in its narrative, and nudged Rahul to make the movie.
Nearly three years ago, they embarked on adapting Pune Highway into a screenplay. It follows the story of Khandu, Vishnu, Nicky, Natasha and Babu, who grew up together in Shantibhavan, a building in Mumbai. Even though an incident on the Pune highway makes Babu a paraplegic, the life of these Shantibhavan residents goes on until one day a body is fished out of a lake, away from the city. As the investigation into the case continues, the friends find themselves grappling with past secrets and new realities.
Though the play was written and directed by Rahul, the film, he says, is a product of their joint vision. ‚ÄúOur main concern was how we would write for the film. What do we keep and what do we let go of? In the end, the characters gained depth and the narrative became visually exciting,‚Äù says Rahul.
In theatre, the story usually progresses sequentially. The shooting of Pune Highway, however, began with its climax. ‚ÄúWe had only three readings before the shoot. So, it was challenging for the actors to stay with the sequence that was being shot that particular day,‚Äù says Rahul, whose agency daCunha Communications helms the Amul Butter topical campaign.
It has been a three-year journey to the theatres. ‚ÄúOnce a play is ready, we open it. However, there is a whole journey after a film is ready ‚Äî promotion planning, releasing its teaser, getting the trailer ready and so on. This is where our experience as ad professionals comes to the fore,‚Äù says Rahul, who has written several popular plays, including Class of ‚Äò84 (2003) and Me, Kash & Cruise (2008).
This writer-director duo will soon be shifting their focus to adapting a literary work for the screen. The film will be based on the first story in Old Cypress And Other Stories (1991) by Rahul‚Äôs mother Nisha daCunha. It explores the complexities of family, identity, and cultural heritage. When Bhargava read it, he was keen to develop the story, titled Old Cypress, a haunting story about finding life and confidence after love ends. ‚ÄúWe are excited to create a visual style that is different from Pune Highway. It is a woman-centric story that looks at what we go through in our 40s and 50s,‚Äù says Bhargava.
Rahul and Nisha had their doubts about its cinematic adaptation. Bhargava, who stuck to this idea, crafted the screenplay, with Rahul making additions to heighten the drama and conflict. ‚ÄúNow I am familiar with what is required when a story transitions from stage to screen. The process of book to screen is more complex,‚Äù says Rahul."
How EVs are a climate solution with pollution problem,https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/tyre-particles-how-evs-are-a-climate-solution-with-pollution-problem-10025113/,"By eliminating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, electric vehicles (EVs) play an important role in the fight against climate change. However, while contributing to solving one problem, they may be adding to another.
A new study by Indian researchers has found that EVs may be bad news for tackling air pollution.
The study, published in Soft Matter, a journal of the Royal Society of Chemistry, has shown that EVs, on account of their greater weight, experience higher wear and tear in their tyres compared to conventional vehicles, and release substantially larger numbers of small plastic particles in the atmosphere.
This could have adverse implications for the health of both humans and the environment.
How tyres are degraded
The disintegration of automobile tyres results in the release of small rubber particles that are air pollutants.
The normal wear and tear of tyres produces particles of broadly two sizes ‚Äì one, about 1-10 micrometres; the other, more than 100 micrometres. Particles of intermediate sizes are also produced, but they are relatively fewer in number.
The study by researchers from theTataInstitute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), IIT Bombay, and Columbia University in the US has, for the first time, established the relationship between the weight and speed of a vehicle to the size of the plastic particles released from tyres as a result of wear and tear.¬†(‚ÄòMechanism of microplastic and nanoplastic emission from tire wear‚Äô, Shankar Ghosh et al.)
The tyres of heavier and faster-moving vehicles produce a higher proportion of smaller particles, shows the study. Unlike the larger particles that settle on the ground due to gravity, smaller particles remain suspended in the air, adding to the concentration of air pollutants.
The study also brings out, for the first time, that particles of different sizes are produced by different physical processes of degradation of tyres.
Thus, degradation caused by sudden braking or encounters with potholes, which the researchers call ‚Äúprimary fragmentation‚Äù, results in the release of mainly smaller particles of varying sizes.
And gradual wear and tear, called ‚Äúsequential fragmentation‚Äù in the study, leads to the release of mainly larger particles.
Thus, an improvement in road quality would likely reduce the release of larger particles, but would have little effect on the smaller particles.
Global relevance of study
The results of the study are globally relevant because of the ongoing push for the adoption of EVs. Electric vehicles are significantly heavier than conventional petrol vehicles because of the batteries ‚Äì which can weigh anything between 300 kg and 900 kg.
The weight of the batteries necessitates the reinforcement of the vehicle frame, which adds to the overall weight. Typically, an EV is at least 15-20% heavier than a comparable conventional vehicle.
EVs are also able to accelerate more rapidly. This can lead to additional stress on the tyres due to increased friction and heat generation.
The tyres of EVs are, therefore, likely to undergo a greater degree of primary fragmentation, releasing larger amounts of smaller plastic particles that add to the concentration of pollutants in the atmosphere.
The findings of the study shed new light on the relatively lesser-studied negative impacts of the deployment of EVs, which is being incentivised around the world.
Road transport accounts for almost 10% of global GHG emissions, the result primarily of the burning of fuel in vehicles.
EVs account for just about 2% of the global vehicle stock, but they contributed to about 20% of new car sales across the world last year, according to an International Energy Agency report.
In India, about 2.5% of cars sold in 2024 were electrics, according to a recent report by S&P Global. The government aims to take this figure to about 30% by 2030. In China, EVs accounted for almost half of all car sales last year.
Potential responses
The researchers say their findings call for different kinds of response measures.
Current air quality regulations in most countries are aimed at controlling PM2.5- and PM10-size particles. Tyre fragments are smaller than these.
With the proliferation of EVs, and tyre fragments becoming a more noticeable constituent of air pollution, these regulations would probably need to be expanded.
At the same time, tyre manufacturers would need to invest in research and development to produce sturdier tyres that are better suited to heavier EVs.
Also, emissions standards would probably need to account for non-exhaust emissions from vehicles.
The researchers have also suggested possible technological fixes ‚Äì such as the possibility of capturing the small tyre fragments at the time of their release, preventing them from getting into the atmosphere."
"Trump vs Harvard: what this means for existing, aspiring students",https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/trump-blocks-harvard-international-students-what-this-means-10023816/,"A US federal judge on Friday temporarily restrained the Donald Trump administration from revoking Harvard University‚Äôs ability to enrol international students, a policy imposed on the elite institution the day before.
In its complaint, Harvard called the revocation a ‚Äúblatant violation‚Äù of the Constitution and federal laws, and said the ban would have an ‚Äúimmediate and devastating effect‚Äù on the university and its international students.
The tussle between the Trump administration and Harvard began after Harvard President Alan M Garber told the administration in April that the university would not accept demands to change its hiring and admissions practices, and its curriculum.

In a letter, dated May 22, the Department of Homeland Security told Harvard that its student and exchange visitor program (SEVP) certification had been revoked, ‚Äúeffective immediately‚Äù.
SEVP certification, which is issued by the DHS, allows colleges and universities in the US to enrol international students on F-1, M-1 and J-1 student visas. An F-1 visa is required for international students to attend an academic institution such as a high school or college, while an M-1 visa is for students in vocational or technical training programs at recognised schools. A J-1 visa is needed for exchange program students.
Without SEVP certification, institutions cannot issue Form I-20, which serves as proof of enrollment and is necessary for visitors to maintain student status.
The DHS letter accused Harvard of perpetuating an ‚Äúunsafe‚Äù campus environment for Jews, promoting ‚Äúpro-Hamas sympathies‚Äù, and employing ‚Äúracial‚Äù diversity, equity and inclusion policies.
While sharing the letter on X, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem accused the university of also ‚Äúcoordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on its campus‚Äù. She wrote, ‚ÄúIt is a privilege, not a right, for universities to enrol foreign students‚Ä¶ They [Harvard] have lost their SEVP certification as a result of their failure to adhere to the law. Let this serve as a warning to all universities and academic institutions across the country.‚Äù
The DHS letter gave Harvard 72 hours to comply with six stringent conditions for its SEVP certification to be restored.
Secretary Noem wrote, ‚ÄúI expect full and complete responses to the following¬†requests:

The move to block enrollment of overseas students affects 6,793 international students who are currently studying at Harvard.¬† If the restraining order were to be lifted, these students will have to find places to study at other universities in the US or risk having to leave the country.
Typically, F-1 students have 60 days, and J-1 students 30 days, to leave the US after completing their studies. However, if their student status is terminated due to a violation, they may have to leave immediately. In Harvard‚Äôs case, it‚Äôs unclear how much time international students would be given to transfer or depart.
Some experts, however, suggest that those finishing their programs and due to receive their degrees next week would probably be allowed a grace period by the DHS.
The revocation of the SEVP certification also means that the DHS ‚Äî responsible for reviewing visa applications ‚Äî could deny a visa to a student who says they are planning to study at Harvard.

International students are a major revenue source for American universities, including Harvard, as they do not receive federal aid and pay higher tuition fees. For instance, most overseas students at Harvard pay full tuition, which is $56,550 for the 2024-25 academic year, either by making direct payments or via scholarships. Housing, food and other mandatory fees amount to an additional $26,316 per student, meaning Harvard makes a sum of $82,866 per year from overseas students.
Exact revenue figures for Harvard are not publicly disclosed, but taking this $82,866 figure into account, the 6,793 international students would be bringing in around $562 million in annual revenue to the university.
In the past four years, the number of overseas students at the university has increased by 26.75%. As of September 2024, international students at Harvard came from 146 countries, with China, Canada and India sending in the largest cohorts, collectively accounting for 40% of the international student population, according to a report by Al Jazeera.
Overseas students also contribute to the US economy. According to the NAFSA Association of International Educators, a non-profit organisation dedicated to international education and exchange, these students contributed approximately $43.8 billion to the US economy during the 2023 ‚Äì 2024 academic year through tuition and fees, and living expenses.
The Trump administration has targeted not just Harvard but also several other elite universities including Brown University, Cornell University, and Columbia University. This came after PresidentDonald Trumpsigned an executive order in March on campus free speech ‚Äî which he deemed a ‚Äúhistoric action to defend American students and American values‚Äù that have ‚Äúbeen under siege‚Äù on campuses.
The trigger for the executive order was a protest movement against Israel‚Äôs war in Gaza that swept college campuses around the country in 2024. Trump cited the alleged harassment of Jewish students as justification for federal intervention.
However, the Trump administration‚Äôs hostility with universities has deeper roots, and is not tied to the conflict in Gaza alone. Conservatives for decades have accused these elite institutes of having a liberal bias, and marginalising right-wing views in lecture halls. They also hold a disdain for the proliferation of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives on campuses, and see these institutes as incubators of ‚Äúwokeness‚Äù.

The story of acid attack survivor Kafi,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/against-all-odds-the-story-of-kafi-an-acid-attack-survivor-who-topped-her-school-10022450/,"Seated with a gentle smile and unwavering confidence in a one-room apartment in Chandigarh is 17-year-old Kafi, a young woman whose story is a testament to the power of resilience and hard work.
At just three years, Kafi‚Äôs life changed forever when an acid attack by a neighbour left her visually challenged and her face disfigured. Fourteen years later, she stands tall as the topper at the Institute for the Blind inChandigarh, securing 95.6% in Class 12 board exams.
‚ÄúI never imagined that one day, despite all odds, my daughter would bring such pride and recognition to our family. I‚Äôm so proud of her,‚Äù says her father, Pawan Kumar, tears welling up in his eyes.
The attack happned on Holi on 2011. ‚ÄúKafi was left just a piece of flesh. We could barely identify her organs. She lost her eyesight completely, and her facial features were severely damaged,‚Äù says her father.
What followed was years of pain and hospital visits. ‚ÄúThe next six years were a nightmare. We spent most of our time at AIIMS,Delhi, for her surgeries. We wondered if she would survive a month or two. Her wounds took more than four years to nurse. People used to say, ‚ÄúHow long will you care for her?‚Äù says Kumar.
Kafi still struggles with physical consequences, and visits to hospitals are frequent. ‚ÄúAs I grow, my skin, especially around my neck and throat, becomes tighter due to scars. My facial skin is very sensitive. I can‚Äôt step out in direct sunlight,‚Äù she says.
She talks about the limitations most people don‚Äôt think about twice. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs disheartening when I realise I can‚Äôt go shopping like others. I can‚Äôt see what I‚Äôm wearing. I wish I could look in the mirror and see myself the way others do.‚Äù
But it‚Äôs not just the physical struggle that lingers. ‚ÄúChildren scream when they see me for the first time. Co-passengers stare with disgust. Some even ask me to cover my face. That hurts more than the physical scars,‚Äù Kafi says. ‚ÄúBut it only fuels my resolve to study hard, succeed, and lift my father out of poverty.‚Äù
With no visual memories from her childhood and limited financial resources, Kafi turned to resources within her reach. A smartphone and audiobooks became her teacher. ‚ÄúI listen to podcasts about success and positivity, follow cricket commentary, stay updated on current affairs, and focus on my studies. It helps me block out negativity. For a visually impaired person, it‚Äôs a blessing in disguise, no distractions,‚Äù she says.
She also enjoys watching the sport that unites India ‚Äî cricket. ‚ÄúI listen to the commentary on my phone and discuss every detail with my younger brother. I love the game because ofVirat Kohli. I admire him a lot,‚Äù she says with enthusiasm.
Asked how she envisions her favourite player, Kafi responds, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt picture anyone visually, but I know him as the fittest guy, with an impeccable personality and amazing consistency. I admire how he balances personal and professional life.‚Äù
Watch Full Episode of Express Cafe Podcast:

Like millions of fans, Kafi too was heartbroken when Kohli announced his retirement from Test cricket. ‚ÄúI was so disappointed. He‚Äôs just 36. Legends likeSachin Tendulkarretired from Tests only after leaving other formats. My mood only lifted the next day when myboard resultscame,‚Äù she laughs.
Despite her admiration, Kafi doesn‚Äôt want pity. ‚ÄúI want to meet Kohli only after I achieve something. I don‚Äôt want anyone to meet me out of sympathy,‚Äù she says with conviction.
Behind Kafi‚Äôs resilience is the father who worked hard to see his daughter succeed. After the attack, Kumar left his ancestral home in Haryana‚Äôs Hisar, sold his property, and relocated to Chandigarh to give Kafi a chance at a better life.
In Chandigarh, struggles continued ‚Äî from job hunting and securing school admission for Kafi to fighting a prolonged legal battle. Kumar says he even took up work as a sweeper. ‚ÄúPeople mocked me. But I had no choice. I cleaned toilets for two years to give my daughter a chance to live.‚Äù
Today, Kumar works as a contractual peon at the Mini Secretariat in Chandigarh and drives an auto-rickshaw at night.
‚ÄúHaving seen my two elder sisters suffer in their marriages, I feared having a daughter. And when she was born, I prayed to God: ‚Äò Bhagwan, yeh ek hi kaafi hai‚Äô (God, one daughter is enough). I didn‚Äôt want her to suffer like my sisters did. So, I named her Kafi,‚Äù says Kumar, on how her daughter got her name. ‚ÄúBut the day I realised my daughter is a blessing and a fighter, I decided I‚Äôll do whatever it takes to support her.‚Äù It‚Äôs my remorse for once wishing: Ek hi Kafi hai.‚Äù
Meanwhile, for Kafi, no dream is too big. She plans to study Political Science at Delhi University and dreams of becoming an IAS officer. ‚ÄúI will work harder to reach that position, and I want to get posted in the same office where my father works as a peon,‚Äù she says.

"Who is Jyoti Malhotra, arrested for espionage",https://indianexpress.com/article/long-reads/jyoti-malhotra-hisar-pakistan-travel-vlogger-social-media-espionage-arrest-10023245/,"She was the girl who travelled ‚Äì across India, Bhutan, Thailand, Pakistan, Nepal, Indonesia and China ‚Äì and documented it. Her social media posts filled with everyday minutiae, from travel tips to the food she ate, Jyoti Malhotra‚Äôs ‚ÄòTravel with Jo‚Äô had over 3,77,000 subscribers and an Instagram account with over 1,32,000 followers.
Yet, in New Aggarsain Colony Extension, a quiet neighbourhood on the outskirts of Hisar in Haryana, her name barely elicits a reaction. Last week,Jyoti was arrested on charges of espionage. The Hisar Police, which is investigating the case, has alleged that she was found sharing ‚Äúsensitive information‚Äù with an official of the Pakistan High Commission inDelhi.
‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know much about her. We heard about her having a YouTube channel only after she came in the news,‚Äù says a neighbour, Seema.
‚ÄúEveryone in this colony mostly keeps to themselves, she wasn‚Äôt any different,‚Äù says another resident. ‚ÄúShe rarely came up to people and greeted them.‚Äù
Jyoti has been charged under Section 152 (acts endangering sovereignty, unity and integrity of India) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) and under various sections of the Officials Secrets Act.
OnLinkedIn, Jyoti describes herself as ‚Äúa blogger in saree‚Äù. The description reads: ‚ÄúFrom her youth, she always wanted to explore and developed a soul of a wanderer. Her passion of travel is also her profession now and she travels and shares her experiences as a travel blogger which are liked around the world and followed by travellers visiting her suggested locations. Among her fans and followers, she is known as a Saree Gal ‚Äì A blogger in saree.‚Äù
Jyoti‚Äôs vlogging began with a trip to Manali, Himachal Pradesh, on August 7, 2019. The description of the video reads: ‚ÄúHi friends. Sat Shri Akaal. I am new on YouTube‚Äù.
Although that video has only 10,000 views, her channel began picking up over the next few years, attracting sponsors ‚Äî from state tourism departments, visa apps and ticket booking sites to fashion and skincare products ‚Äì and even reaching a milestone of 100,000 subscribers in March last year, a feat that secured her the YouTube Silver Play button.
In her videos, she would refer to her viewers as ‚ÄòJo Family‚Äô and would have conversations with locals ‚Äì from the salesperson in a local departmental store in Bali, Indonesia, to a juice vendor in Lahore.
Over the last two years, she uploaded 264 videos, including of her trips to Thailand (October 2024), Dubai (December 2024) and Kerala (January this year). Her Kerala trip shows her on board the Vande Bharat during its trial run between Thiruvananthapuram to Kasargod.
But it was her two visits to Pakistan ‚Äì the first in April 2024, when she took a train from Wagah to Lahore, and the other in March this year, over a month before the Pahalgam terror attack ‚Äì that brought her under official scrutiny, and led to her arrest. According to the police, she allegedly told them that it was in 2023, during a visit to the Pakistan High Commission in Delhi for a travel visa, that she met Ahsan-ur-Rahim alias Danish, a now-expelled official at the commission. Danish was declared persona non-grata and expelled from India on May 13 after he was accused of spying.
‚ÄúI had taken Ahsan-ur-Rahim alias Danish‚Äôs mobile number‚Ä¶ and then I started talking to Ahsan‚Ä¶ After that I traveled to Pakistan twice where I met Ahsan‚Äôs acquaintance Ali Ahwan on the advice of Ahsan-ur-Rahim. Ali Ahwan made arrangements for my stay and travel. In Pakistan, Ali Ahwan arranged my meeting with Pakistani security and intelligence officials‚Ä¶,‚Äù the initial complaint quotes her as saying, adding that she kept in ‚Äúconstant touch‚Äù with the Pakistani officials after she returned.
Her videos from Pakistan ‚Äì which are accompanied by a link to the high commission‚Äôs website ‚Äì have secured her the most engagement: 12 million views for her train video and 1.2 million views for a March 19 video of her exploring Lahore‚Äôs markets. On March 22, she uploaded a video of her attending an Iftar party at the Pakistani High Commission in Delhi that got her 4,23,000 views.
At her home, from where police arrested her on April 16, Jyoti‚Äôs father Harish Malhotra, 58, a carpenter who stopped working during the pandemic following ill-health, says that while he knew about Jyoti‚Äôs travel vlogs, he had no idea how she earned her living. ‚ÄúShe started making videos after the lockdown. When she wasn‚Äôt travelling, she was at home editing videos. I never asked her what she was making. She never shared or invited me on her trips. I did not know she had started making money from her videos, and never asked her to contribute to the household expenses,‚Äù says her father.
Jyoti, an only child, grew up with her father and paternal grandparents after her parents separated when she was six years old. With her grandparents having passed away a few years ago, she lived with her father and his younger brother Khushal, now in his 50s, in Hisar.
Harish‚Äôs illnesses, of which he refuses to disclose details, require regular medication, he says, adding that the family‚Äôs sole source of income is the monthly pension of around Rs 25,000 that Khushal gets from the state electricity department from where he retired.
‚ÄúEvery month, Jyoti would withdraw money from my brother‚Äôs account and give it to the family,‚Äù Harish says.
A student of Hisar‚Äôs Vivekanand High School, Jyoti secured a BA degree from Fateh Chand College, Hisar, and an M.Com degree from Kurukshetra University in 2016 before eventually moving to Delhi to work for a garments and apparel export company as a senior merchandiser.
Her teachers at Vivekanand High School describe her as ‚Äúsharp girl with a rebellious streak‚Äù. ‚ÄúShe was very intelligent‚Ä¶ She was also straightforward while dealing with people. If anyone took her place in class, she was not one to just quietly let it slip. She would make her displeasure known,‚Äù says Sunita Sharma, a coordinator and teacher at the school for over 30 years.
Principal A K Sharma says he lost touch with Jyoti after she cleared her Class 10 in 2006. ‚ÄúHer parents never came to school for anything. It was always her bua (paternal aunt),‚Äù he says, adding that it was only through news channels that he knew of Jyoti‚Äôs vlog.
Less than a week after the initial police complaint, Hisar Superintendent of Police Shashank Kumar Siwan, who is overseeing the investigation, now believes she may not be the ‚Äúsuper spy‚Äù she was portrayed as. ‚ÄúOffences were definitely committed. But it‚Äôs not what is being shown in the media. She is not some super spy, nor did she infiltrate our strategic operations. So far, no vital information about our military or intelligence appears to have been shared by her with the Pakistanis,‚Äù he says, adding that the investigation is ongoing. She has also been questioned by central agencies.
SP Siwan says investigators are now looking into Jyoti‚Äôs finances ‚Äì including her stays at five-star hotels.
At the same time, investigators are also looking into her collaborations with other YouTubers, including one based in Odisha, although no arrests have been made so far.
‚ÄúHer videos of Kerala, she claims, were sponsored by the tourism department but we will have to check,‚Äù the SP says."
Saga of the Chagos Islands,https://indianexpress.com/article/research/saga-of-the-chagos-islands-lingering-legacies-of-british-empire-in-a-modern-worl-9841094/,"The Chagos Archipelago sits at the nexus of decolonisation, international law, and global military strategy. Disputed betwMauritius and the United Kingdom, the islands have become a flashpoint for debates on self-determination and post-colonial territorial integrity. While Mauritius argues that the islands are an inalienable part of its territory, the UK maintains its sovereignty, asserting that the islands will eventually be transferred once they are no longer required for military purposes.
The territorial disputeSovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago remains fiercely contested. Mauritius has repeatedly stated that the archipelago is part of its territory and that the United Kingdom‚Äôs claim is a violation of UN resolutions banning the breakup of colonial territories before independence. In contrast, the UK government asserts its uncontested sovereignty over the islands while also promising that they will be handed over to Mauritius when no longer needed for military purposes. With legal and political forums having yielded little progress, Mauritius has persistently pursued its claim on international stages.
In a dramatic twist, just three months into power, the Labour government celebrated what it described as a diplomatic coup. This move effectively ended a long-running dispute over one of Britain‚Äôs ‚Äúlast imperial possessions,‚Äù while safeguarding a joint UK-US military base on Diego Garcia for decades to come. Yet, the decision has not been met with universal acclaim. The transfer of what is often dubbed Britain‚Äôs ‚Äúlast African colony‚Äù to Mauritius has sparked deep opposition, mistrust, and disappointment from multiple quarters‚Äîeven drawing criticism from members of the Trump administration in the US.
Mauritius, a history
Mauritius is renowned as one of the world‚Äôs most multicultural societies. Its people are largely descendants of Indian labourers, Chinese traders, African slaves, and colonists from the Dutch, French, and British empires. Although Arab and Malay sailors likely visited as early as the 10th century, Mauritius‚Äôs recorded history begins in the 16th century. It was a Portuguese sailor, Don Pedro Mascarenhas, who encountered the island in 1512, although he may not have been the first European to set foot there.
In 1598, a Dutch squadron under Admiral Wybrand Van Warwyck landed at Grand Port and named the island after Prince Maurits van Nassau, the stadtholder of Holland. By 1638, the Dutch had established a settlement, using the island as a base for exploring Australia‚Äôs western coast. Even after the Dutch left Mauritius in 1710, their influence endured through the introduction of sugarcane, domestic animals, and deer.
Five years later, the French arrived. Landing in 1715, they renamed the island ‚ÄòIsle de France‚Äô and established Port Louis as both a naval base and a shipbuilding centre. Under French rule, Mauritius saw an influx of African slaves and the growth of a prosperous sugar industry. The British administration, which began in 1810 with Governor Robert Townsend Farquhar, introduced rapid social and economic reforms, most notably, the abolition of slavery in 1835. Compensation for the loss of slave labour, paid by the Bank of England on behalf of the British government, set in motion what became known as the ‚ÄòGreat Experiment.‚Äô
This experiment highlighted the supposed superiority of free labour over slave labour in plantation colonies, attracting an estimated 462,000 indentured labourers from India, China, Comoros, Madagascar, Mozambique, and Southeast Asia between 1835 and the First World War. Their arrival not only transformed the island‚Äôs economy but also its social fabric.
Sovereignty of the Chagos Archipelago
In 1965, as Mauritius edged closer to independence, the United Kingdom split the Chagos Archipelago away from Mauritius, with the Mauritian government‚Äôs agreement, to form the British Indian Ocean Territory. The new territory also initially included the islands of Aldabra, Farquhar, and Desroches (the latter later returned to the Seychelles upon independence in 1976). Despite these changes, the British retained control of Diego Garcia, an island that now hosts a sprawling US-UK military base and plays a critical role in regional security.
Recent international political pressures pushed the UK to discuss transferring sovereignty over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius. This move is coupled with a 99-year lease for the Diego Garcia base, ensuring its continued strategic utility. On October 3, 2024, the UK announced that it would cede sovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago to Mauritius.
On the strategic front, the utility of the joint US-UK military base on Diego Garcia has been legally secured with the lease. As UK negotiator Jonathan Powell explained on X, ‚ÄúThis deal was reached in close consultation with US officials and puts the base on legally safe ground for the first time in decades.‚Äù
The dual goals of the agreement are clear: to safeguard the security and operational utility of the military base while also aiming to benefit Chagossians‚Äîwho were displaced in 1965 when the islands were separated from Mauritius to facilitate its independence.
However, the decision has proved deeply controversial within the UK. Critics ranging from former Conservative government ministers to various international commentators have labelled the move ‚Äúnaive‚Äù and ‚Äúdangerous,‚Äù arguing that it represents a blow to British prestige.
Although the announcement‚Äôs apparent suddenness ‚Äì coming just three months after the Labour government assumed power ‚Äì suggests haste, the decision is, in fact, the result of a lengthy, complex negotiation process. It is worth noting that a previous Conservative government had already embarked on negotiations after Mauritius brought the matter before theInternational Court of Justice, which in 2019 issued a non-binding opinion favouring Mauritius.
US PresidentDonald Trumphad back then led a diplomatic offensive at the United Nations to bolster the UK‚Äôs claim over the islands. The initiative, however, met with limited success with only three nations, all close political allies of Trump (Israel underBenjamin Netanyahu, Hungary under Viktor Orb√°n, and Australia under Scott Morrison), supporting the US-UK position. Major international players such as Canada, New Zealand, most members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), Japan, and the Republic of Korea abstained.
Later that year, the UN General Assembly voted 116 in favour to six against‚Äîwith 56 abstentions‚Äîon a resolution welcoming the February 25, 2019, International Court of Justice advisory opinion¬†on the legal consequences of separating the Chagos Archipelago from Mauritius. The resolution demanded that the UK unconditionally withdraw its colonial administration from the Chagos Archipelago within six months, allowing Mauritius to complete its decolonisation process.
After a change of government in Mauritius in November 2024, negotiations on the Chagos Islands were reopened in December 2024. Although Mauritius initially sought higher rental fees for the Diego Garcia base, the rental issue appears to have been resolved this month (February 2025), with reports indicating a total payment of around ¬£9 billion over the lease‚Äôs 99-year term.
Strategic considerations
The strategic importance of Diego Garcia cannot be overstated. According to an article in Foreign Policy magazine, ‚ÄúThanks to its vital location, the island houses a military base that served as a critical node for American air operations during the Gulf War and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Post-9/11, it has also been allegedly used as a detention centre by the [US intelligence agency] CIA.‚Äù This underscores the long-standing military significance of the island.
Yet, the implications extend far beyond military logistics. Analysts express concerns that the decision to transfer sovereignty may embolden regional competitors. There are fears that China, for example, could develop commercial ports in the region to rival India‚Äôs growing economic influence. As Samir Puri of the international think tank Chatham House noted, ‚ÄúThis is a long-term matter of concern to monitor, regardless of the UK‚Äôs decision on Chagos.‚Äù
Adding another layer to the geopolitical calculus, Luke de Pulford, Executive Director of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, told the¬†politics and policy news organisation¬†POLITICO, ‚ÄúRecent years have demonstrated beyond doubt China‚Äôs willingness to use their leverage to get what they want from strategic partners.‚Äù His comments come as evidence of Chinese support for Mauritius becomes increasingly visible.
For instance, a major airport in Mauritius was completed in 2013 with a ¬£197 million loan from Beijing, and reports indicate that China has helped construct key infrastructure projects including the state broadcaster‚Äôs headquarters, a dam, and a sports complex. Notably, Mauritius was also the first African nation to sign and activate a free trade agreement with Beijing.
The transfer of sovereignty over the Chagos Islands also invites comparisons with another historic handover ‚Äì Hong Kong‚Äôs return to China in 1997. Under the ‚Äúone country, two systems‚Äù framework, Hong Kong was promised freedoms including freedom of speech, an independent judiciary, and multiple political parties until 2047. However, these assurances were eventually undermined by Beijing‚Äôs policies.
Despite these challenges, strategic considerations in the Indian Ocean differ markedly from those in the Pacific. The Chagos Islands lie in close proximity to India, and the country has welcomed the UK‚Äôs decision. ‚ÄúIn the long run, it is likely that India will play a leading role in Indian Ocean security, and the UK will want to be well-placed to explore how to play a role as an effective partner,‚Äù writes Puri.
Meanwhile, the UK has reassured its critics by insisting that the decision regarding the Chagos Islands is a one-off move‚Äîdistinct from its stance on other overseas territories such as the Falkland Islands and Gibraltar, whose statuses ‚Äúare not up for negotiation,‚Äù according to Foreign Secretary David Lammy.
The saga of the Chagos Islands encapsulates the complexities of decolonisation, international law, and strategic military planning. As Mauritius and the UK navigate their intertwined histories and future aspirations, the dispute over the Chagos Archipelago remains a potent symbol of both the lingering legacies of the empire and the evolving dynamics of global geopolitics."
Cancer therapy gets cheaper and effective,https://indianexpress.com/article/health-wellness/cancer-therapy-cheaper-effective-car-t-cells-hospital-patients-remission-10021554/,"In a significant breakthrough, CAR T-cell therapy, which uses patients‚Äô T-cells to fight cancer by re-engineering them, was developed by and infused at the hospital where they were admitted. Normally, this is done in specialised centres, which pushes up cost and logistics. But with this method, the therapy becomes affordable, costing almost 90 per cent less than the global average.
The phase 1 VELCART trial was conducted successfully at Christian Medical College(CMC), Vellore and was funded by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). ‚ÄúIt is the first trial in the country to do point-of-care development of T-cells in a hospital setting. Once produced, these can be infused to treat patients at a low cost,‚Äù says CMC Vellore director and principal study author Dr Vikram Mathews.
What were the study findings?
Altogether 10 patients, aged between 6 and 59, were selected after other treatments failed to improve their condition. Six of them had acute leukemia and four had lymphoma. They were treated with CAR T-cells developed at CMC Vellore over nine days as part of a point-of-care (PoC) strategy.
The study found that the therapy brought about 100 per cent remission in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia patients and 50 per cent remission in large B-cell lymphoma patients. ‚ÄúOverall, eight of the ten patients remainedcancer-free at a median follow-up of 15 months. The therapy was safe, well-tolerated and had minimal side effects,‚Äù says Dr Mathews. If successful in Phase II trials across multiple centres, this model can be replicated in tertiary hospitals across the country.
How was the therapy developed?
Dr Mathews explains that chimeric antigen receptor T-cells (CAR T-cells) are normal T-cells that are part of the patient‚Äôs own immune system. ‚ÄúThis process usually involves inserting the required genetic information into normal T-cells to produce an antibody receptor that will recognise the antigen/substance on the surface of the cancer cell. This is usually done in large centralised commercial corporations, which contributes to logistic challenges, increased costs, and decreased efficacy,‚Äù he says.
But produced at the hospital site itself, this could be effective at a lower cost. ‚ÄúJust imagine if 100 centres could manufacture CAR T-cells at the hospital. Wouldn‚Äôt it significantly bring down cost in the long run?‚Äù he asked.
Why is the trial significant?
Access to CAR T-cell therapy is limited by cost and turnaround time, even in developed countries. The current centralized model with industry-driven CAR T- cell manufacturing is not viable to the requirements and realities of developing countries like India. Researchers, however, have provided evidence that this is feasible in India.
‚ÄúThe early data from this study establishes its safety and also shows promising results,‚Äù says Dr Mathews.
Redefining cancer therapies
Dr Mathews says researchers used fresh, unfrozen CAR T-cells, which resulted in better outcomes. Unfrozen CAR T-cells are infused directly into the patient after the modification and expansion process, bypassing the freezing step. This approach aims to preserve the cells‚Äô fresh, robust state, potentially leading to better anti-tumour activity. This also means that infusion can occur sooner after the cell modification process, potentially shortening the treatment timeline.
‚ÄúOur trial redefines how cancer therapy can be delivered ‚Äî efficiently, affordably and close to patients. India is leading the way in developing next-generation, in-house biotherapies with global relevance,‚Äù Dr Mathews says.
The study, titled ‚ÄúSafety, efficacy and total cost of point-of-care manufactured anti-CD19 CAR-T cell therapy in India: VELCART trial‚Äù, has been published in the journal Molecular Therapy.

Asiatic lions out of the woods in Gujarat,https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/out-of-the-woods-in-gujarat-why-asiatic-lions-future-cant-be-secured-by-numbers-alone-10022963/,"The latest population estimation exercise in Gujarat has recorded 891 lions, a 32% jump in population since 2020. In these five years, lions have also expanded their range by 17% ‚Äî from 30,000 to 35,000 sq km ‚Äî and now cover 58 talukas (up from 53 in 2020) in 11 districts.
While announcing the numbers on Wednesday (May 21), Gujarat Chief MinisterBhupendra Patelproudly noted that the increase in the lion population is a result not only of favourable geographic and climatic conditions but also of the state government‚Äôs consistent and dedicated efforts. For this success story to continue, however, more needs to be done.
From under200 in the 1960swhen their last home in Gir was accorded special protection, Asiatic lions have made a remarkable recovery. For most parts, this journey has been slow and steady ‚Äî the population did not cross the 300-mark until 1995 when the lion broke free from the safety of the forests.
Between 1990 and 2005, the lion‚Äôs range doubled from 6,600 sq km to 13,000 sq km. But in those early days of breaking new ground, the expansion of lions‚Äô range resulted only in a modest 26% jump in numbers, from 284 to 359.
In the next 15 years, though, as the lion once again doubled its range from 13,000 sq km to 30,000 sq km, already established satellite populations added up to record an overall jump of 88% in lion numbers from 359 to 674.
The latest estimation confirms that trajectory. However, this is only the second instance after the 2015 estimation when the population growth rate exceeded the rate of range expansion. It must also be mentioned that the absolute numbers offered without a standard error range are unusual for any scientific estimation method.
The lions have colonised at least three new areas ‚Äî Barda wildlife sanctuary, Jetpur and Babra-Jasdan ‚Äî in the last five years. A nearly 900-strong population scattered across 358 locations strengthens the species recovery trend that made IUCN change the Asiatic Lion‚Äôs status from ‚Äúcritically-endangered‚Äù to ‚Äúendangered‚Äù in 2008.
A closer look at the numbers, however, shows that the population growth has not been commensurate with the expansion of the lion‚Äôs range over the decades. Since 1990, the lion‚Äôs range has expanded by 430%, but the corresponding jump in numbers, at 214%, has not been half asswift.
This is because the Saurashtra peninsula has very few protected wilderness areas ‚Äî Gir National Park and a few small sanctuaries such as Pania, Girnar, Mitiyala and the recently colonised Berda ‚Äî for the lion to flourish.
Over decades, as these sanctuaries have neared their carrying capacity, lions wandering out for space have reached wasteland, farmland and agri-plantations, interspersed with clumps of natural vegetation tagged as forest patches.
Even on government records, only 56% of Gujarat‚Äôs 891 lions were found in forested areas. While the relevant data is missing in the latest census, the 2020 report showed that the lion‚Äôs population density drops from 15.2 per 100 sq km in forested areas to just 1.65 in non-forested areas.
Non-forest areas close to human habitations are not the ideal habitat for a large carnivore species. A former chief wildlife warden of the state acknowledged that there are ‚Äúcovert cases‚Äù of retaliatory killings when lions died of electrocution, ‚Äúdrowning in wells‚Äù or were ‚Äúshot in self-defence‚Äù.
‚ÄúBut unlike leopards, lions are considered Gujarat‚Äôs pride and people are generally tolerant of the species. Also, these are highly-managed animals with frequent rescues, medical care and all. That makes them somewhat used to people,‚Äù he said.
Familiarity, though, also means such lions are not wary of people. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ecologically an unstable situation. Quite a few of the lions in human-dominated habitats are often aggressive to people, and there have been reports of unprovoked attacks,‚Äù veteran wildlife biologist Dr Ravi Chellam toldThe Indian Express.
Social carrying capacity, argued a senior Gujarat forest official who did not want to be named, also has its limits.
‚ÄúPeople and lions can live in harmony only when they share either space or time. People can work by the day in cropland where lions roam at night. But when they come face to face too often, it‚Äôs a dangerous test of nerves,‚Äù Chellam said.
For now, a combination of awareness campaigns, media sensitisation and timely compensation for livestock losses is keeping peace. What has also helped is the relative availability of wild prey, such as boars, outside forested areas due to limited hunting for bushmeat in the state.
But many lions are also dependent on livestock, including those that they do not have to hunt. ‚ÄúVery frequently, these lions are feeding on dumped livestock carcasses that also attract village dogs. This makes these lions vulnerable to disease infections,‚Äù Dr Chellam cautioned.
It‚Äôs been 12 years since the Supreme Court set a six-month deadline for shifting lions from Gujarat to Madhya Pradesh, and seven years since Gujarat assured the apex court that this order would be implemented.
In September 2020, the initial proposal under Project Lion, which was launched by Prime MinisterNarendra Modion August 15 that year, identified seven sites, including three each in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, for relocation.
Then, in July 2022, the government told the Lok Sabha that the scope of assessing the suitability of a new habitat for lions was limited to potential sites only within Gujarat. On their own, lions have recently reached one of those sites ‚Äî Barda wildlife sanctuary. But the sanctuary‚Äôs less than 200 sq km expanse can accommodate only a few animals.
As potential targets of doubling the lion population to 2,000 are being tossed around, the Asiatic lion needs quality forest habitats away from human settlements to safeguard against potential conflict and epidemic breakouts.

"Story of ‚Äòrat temple‚Äô near Bikaner, visited by PM Modi",https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/rat-temple-bikaner-modi-10025966/,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday (May 24) visited the Karni Mata temple in Deshnok, a small town about 30 km from Bikaner, Rajasthan. Dubbed the ‚Äúrat temple‚Äù, this historical place of worship is famous for being the home to tens of thousands ofkabas(rats), which are considered sacred and protected.
Karni Mata, also known as Ridhi Kanwar or Ridhu Bai, is believed to have been a 14th‚Äì15th sage, and an incarnation of Goddess Durga. She is said to have been born in 1387 CE in the village of Suwap near Phalodi, about 100 km from Deshnok, into a Charan family. (Traditionally, Charans are bards, or court poets and genealogists.)
It is said that Ridhi Kanwar was in her mother‚Äôs womb for 21 months, and her coming was foretold by Goddess Durga herself, who appeared in her mother‚Äôs dreams. Upon performing many miracles while growing up, Ridhi Kanwar was given the name Karni Mata.
Historical details ofKarni Mata‚Äôs life are scant, and much of what is known about her comes from oral tradition and hagiographies, such as theKarni Mata Charitra, which portray her as a spiritual leader who performed miracles and supported rulers including Rao Jodha, the founder of Jodhpur, and Rao Bika ji, the founder of Bikaner.
It is said that both Jodhpur and Bikaner were established in 1459 and 1488, respectively, with Karni Mata‚Äôs blessings. Her followers say she lived for 151 years, before her ‚Äúascension‚Äù in 1538 AD.
The present structure of the Karni Mata Temple was commissioned in the early 20th century by Maharaja Ganga Singh of Bikaner.
‚ÄúKarni Mata represents a blend of folk sainthood and goddess worship unique to western Rajasthan,‚Äù notes Prof Lindsey Harlan, inReligion and Rajput Women: The Ethic of Protection in Contemporary Narratives(University of California Press, 1992).
Charans consider Karni Mata as not just a goddess but also as theirkuldevi(tutelary deity). The priests at the Karni Mata temple have traditionally been Charans, who trace their lineage to her family. The community maintains custodianship of the temple.
‚ÄúFor the Charans, Karni Mata is not only divine but a blood relation, which reinforces their caste identity and social authority in the region‚Äù wrote Prof Ann Grodzins Gold, inFruitful Journeys: The Ways of Rajasthani Pilgrims(University of California Press, 1988).
Karni Mata is also deeply venerated by Rathore Rajputs, the dominant warrior caste in the region. Her blessings to Rao Jodha and Rao Bika, both Rathore kings, leads to many many Rajput clans in Rajasthan considering her their royal protector and family deity. ‚ÄúThe Karni Mata cult reflects the intertwining of folk sainthood with the political legitimisation of early Rajput kingdoms,‚Äù noted Prof Harlan.
The first Karni Sena, the Shri Rajput Karni Sena (SRKS) which was created in 2006, derives its name from Karni Mata.
Karni Mata is also worshipped by other castes, including the Meghwals and Malis. Her reputation as a just, miracle-working saint who protected her people transcends caste, and her temple offers equal access to devotees.
Locally known askabas, rats are believed to be incarnations of Karni Mata‚Äôs family members.
Legend has it that when her stepson Laxman, also known as Lakhan, drowned, Karni Mata asked Yama, the god of death, to revive him. Yama relented and allowed him and other members of her lineage to be reborn as rats, avoiding the cycle of death and rebirth.
Other legends say that when Yamaraj said he was unable to do so, Karni Mata herself revived Lakhan and decreed that her family members would no longer die but be re-incarnated as rats. Hundreds of families living near the temple claim to be descendants of Karni Mata.
This belief has transformed the rodents into holy beings: rats are considered to be Karni Mata‚Äôs descendants, who will then take birth as humans, and then again as rats again in the temple, and so on.
There are more beliefs surrounding the rats, one being that despite the presence of a large number of rats, there have been no diseases or infection; that their numbers have mostly stayed the same over the centuries; that there is no foul smell when they die; and that they don‚Äôt leave the temple premises.
Theprasadtouched by the rats is also considered sacred and followers say that it holds the power to cure ailments. Moreover, spotting a white rat is considered auspicious.
The temple holds immense significance for the armed forces in the district bordering Pakistan. That said, the temple‚Äôs association with the armed forces dates back to the pre-Independence era, long before Pakistan was on the map.
Col Mahendra Singh Chandel (retd), recipient of Vishisht Seva Medal,¬† said: ‚ÄúKarni Mata has been a deity of the erstwhile Bikaner state‚Äôs armed forces: the Karni Battalion, Sadul Infantry, Dungar Lancers, Vijay Battery and the Ganga Risala.
Of these, the Sadul Infantry and Karni Battalion were converted into the 19 Rajput Battalion, which is still sometimes known as 19 Rajput Karni Battalion. Similarly, the Vijay Battery was merged into 41 Field Regiment Artillery and is still sometimes known as 41 Field Karni Regiment.‚Äù
As part of the tradition, the Commanding Officers of the 19 Rajput Battalion visit the temple whenever they take over. And, duringnavratra, two non-commissioned officers (NCOs) are sent to the temple to make special offerings on behalf of the Battalion.
Karni Mata is seen as a symbol of divine feminine power and is invoked for courage, protection and success, particularly by soldiers with Rajasthani roots. It is common for serving soldiers from the region to visit the temple in uniform, offer prayers, and seek blessings before joining field duty or deployment.
‚ÄúMilitary reverence for Karni Mata reflects the traditional martial values of Rajputana, where deities are protectors and guardians in both spiritual and battlefield realms,‚Äù said Col R S Rathore (retd), in an interview published inthe Journal of Indian Military History, 2015."
Intruder shot dead by BSF along Indo-Pak border in Gujarat,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/ahmedabad/intruder-shot-dead-by-bsf-india-pakistan-border-gujarat-10026095/,"The Border Security Force (BSF) shot dead a Pakistani intruder attempting to enter from the India-Pakistan international border in Gujarat, an official said on Saturday.
Alert BSF troops spotted a suspicious person advancing towards the border fence after crossing the international border in Banaskantha on Friday night, the BSF stated in a release.

"Monsoon arrives in Kerala, earliest onset since 2009: IMD",https://indianexpress.com/article/india/kerala-monsoon-arrival-india-onset-imd-10025729/,"The southwest monsoon has made an early entrance into the Indian subcontinent this year, arriving over Kerala on Saturday ‚Äî eight days ahead of its typical June 1 onset, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said.
This marks the earliest onset since 2009, when the monsoon reached the state on May 23. Over the past week, Kerala has witnessed a noticeable uptick in rainfall.
The IMD declares the monsoon‚Äôs arrival over Kerala based on three primary indicators: rainfall of at least 2.5 mm recorded at a minimum of 14 meteorological stations for two consecutive days, deep westerly winds extending up to 600 hectopascals, and a decline in Outgoing Longwave Radiation values below 200 watts per square meter.
This early onset signals the beginning of the crucial four-month-long rainy season, vital to agriculture, water resources, and economic stability across the country.
The Met department has issued warnings of extremely heavy rainfall ‚Äî exceeding 205 mm in 24 hours ‚Äî through Monday in Kerala and Mahe, with similar weather conditions forecast for coastal Karnataka.
Adding to the turbulent weather, a well-marked low-pressure area off the Konkan-Goa coast intensified into a depression on Saturday and was expected to make landfall near Raigad in Maharashtra by evening. Squally winds and strong monsoonal currents were already prevailing across the Arabian Sea.
This year, the IMD has forecast rainfall to be ‚Äúabove normal,‚Äù estimating the total to be at 105 per cent of theLong Period Average(LPA) of 880 mm. Two major oceanic influences ‚Äîthe El Ni√±o‚ÄìSouthern Oscillation and the Indian Ocean Dipole ‚Äî are currently in a neutral phase, a condition expected to support monsoonal activity.
The monsoon is projected to advance into the remaining parts of south peninsular and northeast India, along with additional areas of east and central India, between May 29 and June 4.

How does Alcaraz trap Sinner in the backhand corner? Like Nadal did vs Federer,https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/tennis/alcaraz-vs-sinner-backhand-french-open-2025-nadal-federer-trap-10025366/,"This weekend, after 20 years, Rafael Nadal wouldn‚Äôt be competing for the French Open title. Novak Djokovic will be there, but in a way, he too isn‚Äôt in the competition to take the Cup home. At 38, he looks too jaded, too uninspired to win five-setters on clay against Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner, the 20-something stars ready to conquer the world.
Generational shifts can take a toll on fans. It‚Äôs tempting to get wistful about the end of tennis‚Äôs golden age, entertain thoughts of staying aloof to the happenings at Roland Garros. It‚Äôs also a guilt-ridden ordeal to switch loyalties, root for the new stars when the old ones are still around.

The new crowd-pullers, Alcaraz and Sinner are still works in progress but there is a bit of the Biggest 3 in the current Top 2. Watch Alcaraz, and Sinner carefully to stumble upon a few snatches of the incredible era that has just passed us. When the two face-off ‚Äî like they did in the Italian Open this week and a repeat is expected this French Open ‚Äî there is a whiff of those many iconic duels that divided the world that felt lucky to have lived in the Age of GOATs. Not full-length blockbusters to match the classics, but reels and shorts.
At Rome where Alcaraz won 7-6, 6-1, there were those fleeting moments that reminded of the cat & mouse hustle of Federer vs Nadal vs Djokovic match days. Alcaraz beating Sinner on his home ground wasn‚Äôt a match for ages. Historically, the Spaniard has the Italian‚Äôs number, he mostly gets the better of him. But it is not to say Sinner didn‚Äôt have a chance or that his straight sets loss didn‚Äôt have intrigue or promise of a riveting rivalry in the future. Not quite the teaser, it was more of a prequel before the French Open.

Like it was on Italian clay last Sunday, when the two meet, rallies are expected to be on one side of the court ‚Äì a series of backhand cross-courts by two hard-hitting right-handers stationed slightly on the left of the court. Both would try to press the other to hit a soft return probably around the mid-court so that they can unleash their big inside out forehand. Whoever manages to play percentage tennis ‚Äì deep incisive shots on the rival‚Äôs backhand ‚Äì would be favourite to win. In Rome, Alcaraz did it and so he won.
This trend was best captured by that one crucial point that decided the match. Sinner was a point away from taking the first set, he led 6-5, 40-30. This was the time when Alcaraz had to play percentage tennis and also be true to his Plan A.
The Spaniard hit a near perfect top-spinner on the backhand that landed close to baseline and he stood waiting for a lame return, expecting a defensive shot in mid-court that he could destroy. Sinner thought of attacking the ball and opted for a very difficult backhand down-the-line, one-knee jump backhand pass. Glory or nothing.
He missed the line by a distance. If it was not clay, had it not been Alcaraz, Sinner might have been able to pull off the tough shot. But not against Alcaraz, when he is landing the ball where he wants ‚Äî deep in the backhand corner.
This ‚Äòplay‚Äô has history, it is part of a very important tennis culture. Like any self-respecting Spaniard, the boy from El Palmar who grew up on red-clay, banks on this heavy top-spin ball to pin his opponents on the baseline. It‚Äôs Spain‚Äôs national clay-tactic from the days of Sergi Bruguera and later mastered by the Clay King himself, Nadal. Alcaraz‚Äôs spin on the ball is nowhere near Nadal‚Äôs whiplash forehand that would send the ball in a crazy tizzy but he does get a mean bounce.
Nadal re-romanticised Federer‚Äôs famous single-handed backhand with this tactic. He exploited the limitation of one wrist, forearm and shoulder to control and impart power to high top-spinners. The Swiss champion would always find it tough to bring the ball down that never stopped climbing on him. Later in his rivalry with Nadal, he would opt for a racket with a larger frame as he wanted a bigger sweet spot.

‚ÄòBackhand heist‚Äô
Alcaraz‚Äôs ‚Äòbackhand heist‚Äô against Sinner is slightly different. At Rome, he would reduce the pace of his shot but made it a point to play them deep on Sinner‚Äôs left. Once in a while, he would even float a moon ball. Alcaraz knows that in case he engages Sinner in fast backhand cross court rallies, he could be blown away. The Italian has power and consistency. But hitting the ball in slow parabolas, he can possibly disturb Sinner‚Äôs rhythm and force him to generate his own power.
This results in unforced errors or feeble returns that can be despatched with ease. Hitting the ball consistently on the baseline has another advantage on clay. Since it‚Äôs the court‚Äôs most foot-stomped area, bounce also isn‚Äôt consistent. There isn‚Äôt an inch of clay court that the Spaniards don‚Äôt know.
What will always give Alcaraz an edge over Sinner on clay is his footwork and shot variety. The Spaniard has it in his tennis DNA to float around on clay, nor scamper around. He doesn‚Äôt over-run the ball or stutter before hitting it. Sinner, on clay, does both at times. A problem that vanishes on hard courts.
When in flow, Alcaraz makes his opponents look inadequate with his variety. The point with which he broke Sinner for the first tie in the second set showcased his arsenal. A flat hard first serve, few forehand cross courts, a moon ball on the backhand, deep slice on the forehand and finally the sucker punch. Having left the left side of the court vacant chasing the slice on the forehand, the Italian gets ready to sprint towards the backhand. Just as he takes off, Alcaraz, at the very last minute, decides to play his trademark audacious drop shot.
The ball drops dead close to the net, Sinner deflates at the baseline. Mind you, the points won and lost at the Rome finals didn‚Äôt end with full stops, it was a comma and they came with ‚Äòto be continued‚Äô post-script. Rome gave an idea about what Paris could be and how future Alcaraz-Sinner clay encounters would unfold.
The French Open wouldn‚Äôt be what it used to be. The page has turned, characters replaced, storyline changed but the play has a ‚Äòseen this before‚Äô feel. It‚Äôs new wine, new bottle but there is a strange aftertaste that seems all too familiar."

The allegation: ‚ÄúDemand and acceptance of bribes for granting bail to accused persons.‚Äù
The request was passed on to theDelhiHigh Court, which turned it down on February 14, saying the ACB did not have ‚Äúsufficient material‚Äù against the Special Judge. However, it asked the ACB to continue its investigation and suggested that it approach them again if any material showing the Special Judge‚Äôs involvement is found.
On May 16, the ACB registered an FIR against the court ahlmad.
On May 20, the Special Judge was transferred from Rouse Avenue Court to another court.
Queries sent to the Registrar of the Delhi High Court did not elicit a response.The Indian Expressalso reached out to the judge in question, who declined to comment on the matter.
The Indian Expresshas learnt that the ACB letter dated January 29 had the subject line: ‚ÄúRegarding complaints received against officials of Rouse Avenue district courts, ahlmad and the Special Judge, along with audio recording of conversations.‚Äù
In the letter, the ACB mentioned a case registered in April 2023 against a GST officer for allegedly sanctioning GST refunds to fake/bogus firms in 2021. Sixteen people ‚Äî including the GST officer, three advocates, a chartered accountant and two transporters ‚Äî were arrested by the ACB and produced before the Special Judge‚Äôs court, which sent them to judicial custody. Once the accused started filing bail applications, most of their applications were heard, deferred and kept reserved for different dates, the ACB noted.
The first complaint was received via email by the ACB on December 30, 2024, from a relative of the GST officer, alleging that they were approached by the court officials, demanding a bribe of Rs 85 lakh for her bail and Rs 1 crore for each of the other accused.
‚Äú(The relative) alleged that on refusal, the bail application was unjustly prolonged for more than a month, and later dismissed. Subsequently, they got relief from the Delhi High Court and were approached by one of the accused, allegedly threatening that the judge concerned would do everything adverse within his powers to prosecute her. He asked her to withdraw her application from the HC, pay Rs 1 crore, and she would be granted bail,‚Äù the ACB wrote.
Another complaint, sources said, was received on January 20 from a person who alleged he was approached by the court ahlmad in the first week of January, offering that three people accused in a case can get bail if they are ready to pay a bribe of Rs 15-20 lakh per person.
The ACB wrote in its letter that prima facie, the contents of the complaints and audio recordings corroborate the sequence of events pertaining to bail hearings, including postponements in the court concerned.
‚ÄúIn view of the facts of the case, the complaints, corroborative audio recordings, and the sequence of events surrounding the bail hearings, prima facie, indicate a serious misconduct involving demand and acceptance of bribes for granting bail to accused persons involved in such a sensitive case. The alleged involvement of court staff (and) the role attributed to the special judge raise grave concerns regarding the integrity of judicial proceedings in this case. Given the sensitivity and seriousness of the matter, it is requested that permission to investigate may kindly be sought from the appropriate authority,‚Äù it said.
On February 14,¬† the Principal Secretary of the Law department received a reply from the Registrar (Vigilance) of the Delhi High Court, which read, ‚ÄúAs of now, there is no sufficient material regarding the involvement of an officer (Special Judge) in the alleged incident. Accordingly, presently, there is no requirement to grant permission qua the said judicial officer. However, the investigating agency is at liberty to carry on with the investigation with respect to the complaints received. I am further directed to inform you that if, during the course of investigation, any material is collected which shows the involvement of the said judicial officer in the alleged incident, warranting action against him, the investigating agency is at liberty to make a fresh request to this court seeking appropriate permission qua the said Judicial Officer.‚Äù
On May 16, the ACB registered an FIR under the Prevention of Corruption Act against the court ahlmad and also mentioned the reply of the Registrar (Vigilance) in it. The ahlmad filed an anticipatory bail in a Rouse Avenue court.
During the bail hearing, the advocates argued that the ACB had filed a ‚Äúfalse fabricated FIR‚Äù against the ahlmad and had ‚Äútried to frame‚Äù the Special Judge to ‚Äúsettle a score with‚Äù him.
The Chief Public Prosecutor, who represented the State, opposed the bail on the grounds that the ahlmad was a prime offender and was likely to tamper with evidence. He also argued that a handwritten slip was allegedly provided by him to the complainant, which indicated his involvement in the alleged offence.
On May 22, the court rejected the ahlmad‚Äôs anticipatory bail application.

Struggling with poor mobile signal? Try these 5 fixes,https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/techook/5-tricks-bad-mobile-signal-good-10015755/,"Nothing can be worse than discovering that your mobile network is down when you‚Äôre on a road trip. No music, no GPS, and no way to call for help in case of an emergency. The good news is that there are a few easy solutions that could get you back online quickly, even though a weak signal can cause other kinds of issues.
These easy tips can help improve reception and keep you connected when you need it most, whether you‚Äôre using anAndroidor iPhone. There are several ways to improve your iPhone or Android phone‚Äôs reception, irrespective of the kind of plan you‚Äôre on, whether you‚Äôre performing regular phone maintenance or you‚Äôre in an emergency.
Here‚Äôs how to stop dropped calls and get a strong signal on your phone.
A quick way to fix a weak signal is by switching ‚ÄòAirplane Mode‚Äô on and off. This refreshes your phone‚Äôs connection toWi-Fi, Bluetooth, and the mobile network so it can find a better signal.
On Android:Swipe down from the top of the screen to open Quick Settings. Tap the Airplane Mode icon. Wait about 15 seconds until it‚Äôs fully off, then tap it again to turn it off.
On iPhone:If you own an iPhone, swipe down from the top-right corner and tap the Airplane Mode icon (it turns orange when it‚Äôs on). Wait 15 seconds, then tap the icon again to turn it off.
If your phone‚Äôs signal is still weak, resetting the network settings can help fix it. This gives your phone a fresh start with Wi-Fi, mobile data, and Bluetooth. But keep in mind, it will also deletesaved Wi-Fi passwords, VPNs, and special settings from your mobile carrier.
On Android:Open the Settings app and search for ‚ÄòReset network settings‚Äô. On some phones likeGoogle‚Äôs Pixel, it may be called ‚ÄòReset Wi-Fi, mobile & Bluetooth‚Äô. After the reset, you‚Äôll need to reconnect to Wi-Fi networks again.
On iPhone: Go to Settings, then head to Transfer or Reset iPhone, click on Reset, and click Reset Network Settings. You‚Äôll see a message warning that your Wi-Fi, mobile, and Bluetooth settings will be reset. Tap Reset Network Settings, and your phone will restart.
Your phone company sometimes sends updates to improve your signal for calls, data, and texts. These updates are called carrier settings. iPhones get them automatically, but not all Android phones do.
On iPhone:If there‚Äôs a carrier update, a message will pop up on your screen. You can also check manually by going to Settings and heading to About section under General tab. If an update is available, your phone will tell you.
On Android:Not all Android phones have this option. Open Settings and search for ‚ÄòCarrier Settings‚Äô to see if you have it. On Pixel phones, go to Settings &gt; Network & internet > Internet, tap the gear next to your carrier, then tap ‚ÄòCarrier Settings‚Äô to check for updates.
Phones are like small computers, and sometimesa simple restart can fix network problems.
On Android:Press and hold the power button (or power + volume down, depending on your phone) until a menu appears. Tap Restart. If you don‚Äôt see that option, tap Power Off, wait for your phone to shut down, then turn it back on by holding the power button.
On iPhone:Press and hold the side button and either volume button until a power slider appears. Swipe to turn it off. Once it‚Äôs fully off, press and hold the side button again to turn it back on.
If you‚Äôre still having signal issues, take out your SIM card and put it back in. This can help fix connection problems. If the SIM card looks dirty, gently clean it. If it looks damaged, you might need to get a new one.
All Phones:Take out the SIM card, check for damage, make sure it‚Äôs sitting properly in the tray, then put it back into your phone.
Staying connected is crucial, especially during travel or emergencies. By following these simple tips like switching to Airplane Mode, resetting network settings, checking for updates, and removing the SIM card, one can quickly boost your phone‚Äôs signal.

Piano man Billy Joel‚Äôs rare brain disorder: Why we need to watch these symptoms in those above 60s,https://indianexpress.com/article/health-wellness/billy-joel-brain-disorder-rare-normal-pressure-hydrocephalus-symptoms-cure-10025681/,"By Dr Vishal Chafale
Singer-songwriter Billy Joel has said he has been diagnosed with aneurological condition that prevents him from performingfor some time. He is suffering from normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), where the fluids inside your brain cavities are overproduced, cannot be absorbed and accumulate over time. This is a medical malady that is both under-recognised and frequently misinterpreted. Joel has cited disturbances in balance, hearing and vision.
At first glance, the term normal pressure hydrocephalus appears oxymoronic ‚Äî how can a condition characterised by fluid accumulation in the brain occur under ‚Äúnormal‚Äù pressure? Your body makes just enough cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) that nourishes the brain and spinal cord and can be absorbed. Here CSF is in excess and cannot be absorbed by the body. Hence it settles in the ventricles or chambers of the brain, enlarging them and compressing adjacent brain tissue. Yet the pressure within the skull remains seemingly within normal limits, thus eluding easy detection.
The condition manifests through a triad of symptoms that are as disruptive as they are subtle:
‚óè Gait disturbances, often mistaken for clumsiness or frailty;
‚óè Cognitive impairment, echoing the early murmurings of dementia;
‚óè Urinary incontinence, a loss of bladder control.
Most patients have trouble walking, develop balance problems and have falls. They complain of forgetfulness, confusion, depression and cannot follow questions.
What causes normal pressure hydrocephalus?
The normal flow of CSF throughout the brain and spinal cord gets blocked. This could be because of past injuries or bleeding, infection, brain tumor, or surgery. The extra fluid and pressure can lead to brain damage over time.
It is difficult to diagnose this condition because its symptoms overlap with many other conditions. In older adults, diagnosis is difficult because it is assumed to be Alzheimer‚Äôs or Parkinson‚Äôs. Yet unlike these neurodegenerative conditions, normal pressure hydrocephalus is treatable.
It can be diagnosed with neuroimaging, followed by a lumbar puncture that, if relieving symptoms even temporarily, is confirmatory.
Neurosurgeons implant a shunt under your scalp, a slender conduit that diverts excess fluid from the brain to the gut where it is absorbed. The shunt is inserted into the affected ventricle in the brain and then placed under your skin from your head through your neck and chest to your abdomen. When effective, the patient recovers quickly, regaining their cognitive and motor faculties. But it doesn‚Äôt work well with some patients and has limited benefits. Diuretics usually don‚Äôt work in this condition.
Cognitive decline is too often dismissed as an age-related problem and even treatable conditions are left undiagnosed. So if you see somebody‚Äôs steps faltering, their thoughts clouding, or their continence waning, do not dismiss it as an old age problem. It might just be a reversible neurological condition.
